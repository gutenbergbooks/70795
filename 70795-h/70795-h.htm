<p>On the fourth day of cold February in that cold
town of Hanover, in the year 1707, of a brilliant and
beautiful young mother, in the great palace on the
little river Leine, was born—perhaps it would be
more correct to say crept into the world, for there
was so little noise about it—a Prince of whom in
after years his father remarked: “My dear first-born
is the greatest ass and the greatest liar and the
greatest <i lang="fr">canaille</i> and the greatest beast in the
whole world, and I heartily wish he was out of it.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
If this worthy parent—who by-the-bye was no less
a personage than King George the Second of
England at the time of speaking—had any reason
or truth in this most fatherly comment with its
charitable tail-piece by way of benediction, then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
must this little German potentate—by accident
King of England—have been gifted in addition to
his other fine and gentlemanly qualities of perception,
with the power of divining the future, for
his dislike, nay, his inveterate hatred, of this little
vaunted first-born son commenced at his earliest
years. Why, the good God alone knows, for
certainly none of His creatures have ever up to
the present time succeeded in discovering the
cause.</p>

<p>The beautiful young mother then, Caroline, a
Princess of Brandenburg-Ansbach, commonly called
“Caroline of Ansbach,” married but a year to her
George Augustus—only the Electoral Prince<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> at
that time—lay happy in her bed in the palace,
with her baby beside her, whilst the cold river
ran without and the winter winds blew among the
dear orange trees in the gardens she was so fond of
two miles away at Herrenhausen, and very few
people in Hanover and still fewer in England knew
that a possible future Prince of Wales had been born
into the world, for perhaps after all, very few people
very much cared. Anne of England was still on
the throne.</p>

<p>So quiet had this matter been kept and so great
a surprise was the event that Howe, the English
Envoy, wrote home in the following strain:—</p>

<p>“This Court having for some time past almost
despaired of the Princess Electoral being brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
to bed, and most people apprehensive that her
bigness, which has continued for so long, was
rather an effect of a distemper than that she was
with child, her Highness was taken ill last Friday
at dinner, and last night, about seven o’clock, the
Countess d’Eke, her lady of the bedchamber, sent
me word that the Princess was delivered of a son.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>On the 25th February Howe writes again complaining
bitterly like a wicked fairy in a children’s
tale, that he has not been invited to the christening
which had taken place a few days after the birth in
the young mother’s bedroom, when the child had
received the names of Frederick Louis. Furthermore,
he had not been allowed to see the baby—and
presumably to kiss it—until ten days later! This
visit, however, appears to have mollified him, for he
bursts forth into description: “I found the women,”
he says, “all admiring the largeness and strength
of the child.”</p>

<p>One can see them doing it, and the dry old
Envoy—it is presumed he was a bachelor as he
makes no mention of his wife—looking on, and as
much at sea with regard to the “points” of a fine
baby as a midwife would be at a horse show.</p>

<p>But this unusual secrecy about the birth—which
was attributed to the child’s grandfather the Elector,
afterwards George the First of England, who was
not on the best of terms with Anne our reigning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
Queen—had another aspect. It was an age of
suspicion, suspicion especially of substituted heirs,
and the foolishness of not inviting the English
Envoy to the birth according to custom, revolting as
it would have been to a young modest wife, might
have seriously prejudiced the child’s future had he
not been born with, and had to struggle against, so
many of those distinctive bad qualities so carefully
nurtured and indulged by his father and grandfather.
On a later occasion his father remarked to
his mother <i lang="la">a propos</i> of these: “<i lang="fr">Mais vous voyez
mes passions ma chère Caroline. Vous connaissez
mes foiblesses.</i>” Yes, that affectionate and long-suffering
lady <em>did</em> know his “foiblesses” before she
had been his wife very long. Thoroughly to appreciate
the nest into which this unfortunate little
Prince was born and christened, it is necessary to
turn for a moment to the habits and customs of his
father and grandfather.</p>

<p>Taking the latter first, the Elector and future
King of England was in the habit of retaining
without any concealment whatever a minimum of
three mistresses. These ladies, this considerate old
father-in-law expected his son’s wife to receive and
treat with civility, and strange to say Caroline the
Princess Electoral did it. Poor soul! She had
much more than that to wink at on her own
account before long owing to the before-mentioned
“foiblesses” of her little husband.</p>

<p>The chief of her father-in-law the Elector’s little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
harem was a lady of the name of Schulemburg, of
an ancient but poor family, who had occupied her
exalted position almost from a very plain girlhood,
and whose name became subsequently very well
known in England.</p>

<p>The first George never distinguished himself as a
seeker after beauty. The Schulemburg is described
as a tall, thin person, quite bald, wearing a very
ugly red wig, and with an uncomely face much
marked with the smallpox. This disfigurement she
endeavoured to cover with paint with shocking
results.</p>

<p>The lady occupying the second position in the
seraglio who bore the euphonic name of Kielmansegge,
and was the separated wife of a Hamburg
merchant, was of exactly opposite dimensions,
bulking large with great unwieldiness, she, however,
had no need to redden her cheeks, being gifted by
Nature with a plenteous colour which she vainly
endeavoured to assuage with layers of white powder.</p>

<p>The advent of this Ruler in public with either or
both of these fascinating ladies under his immediate
protection must have added considerably to his
Electoral dignity.</p>

<p>The third of this honourable trio was, strange to
say, a beautiful young woman, the Countess Platen,
married to a man whose family seems to have
provided courtesans for princes for generations, but
it was so far to the Count Platen’s credit that when
his wife openly became the Elector’s mistress he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
separated from her. This lady seems to have simply
thrust herself into the old Elector’s arms, and
appears for a time, at least, to have absorbed most
of his superfluous elderly affection.</p>

<p>But about the time that little Prince Frederick
Louis, the subject of these Memoirs, was about two
years old, a little sister—Anne, named apparently
after the Queen of England—having joined him in
the nursery, a certain couple of adventurers—for
they were nothing better—Henry Howard, third
son of the Earl of Suffolk, with his pretty but
unscrupulous wife Henrietta, made their appearance
at the Court of Hanover. They had come, like
many others from England, to throw in their lot
with the Elector and his chances of becoming King
of England, which at that time were none too sure,
but still a good sporting chance.</p>

<p>Henry Howard and his wife had come like the
others to better their fortunes, which apparently in
their case had arrived at that stage when they
could not well be much worse.</p>

<p>It is reported that so short of money were they
on their arrival that Mrs. Howard had to cut off
her beautiful hair and sell it—her glory!—to
provide a conciliatory banquet for some powerful
Hanoverian acquaintances. One can almost add a
tear to those she surely shed over the shorn locks in
private. But the loss of her hair does not appear
to have handicapped her in any way from the point
of view of fascination. She quickly ingratiated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
herself with the Elector’s aged mother, Sophia,
granddaughter of James the First of England, and
Protestant heiress of England by Act of Parliament,
talked English with her, and became one of her
intimate friends. From this, it was but a step to
the favour of Caroline, the wife of the Elector’s son,
and Mrs. Hettie Howard was by no means the kind
of lady to let grass grow under her feet. She was
said to be a great adept at flattery, knowing just
how much to tickle the ears of Royalty with
Electoral Royalty. She tickled to such effect that
she soon became one of the Princess’s ladies-in-waiting,
and as such no doubt had the privilege of
dandling our Prince Frederick as an infant in her
arms.</p>

<p>But apparently she had not as yet hit her
mark; it was at the heart of the little Prince’s
father that her darts were aimed, and certainly
never was a target more ready to receive them.
George Augustus had ever posed as a lady’s man,
yet this incident was possibly the first which opened
the eyes of his young wife to his subsequently
deplored “foiblesses.” The Electoral Prince followed
in the exemplary footsteps of his father, the
Elector; he started the nucleus of a harem, and
Mrs. Hettie Howard obligingly became the nucleus!
One more good example to set before the little
Prince when his eyes—and ears—should open to
understand the wicked things of this world!</p>

<p>The comment of George Augustus’s aged grandmother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
the Electress on this arrangement—with
which, by-the-bye, she was rather pleased—was
quite German and appropriate. “Ah!” she
remarked, “it will improve his English.”</p>

<p>Though the position of the House of Hanover at
this time with regard to the throne of England
was considered to be good, yet it was by no means
sure. The two following letters will, perhaps, throw
some light on the period.</p>

<p>The first is from Leibnitz, a <i lang="fr">savant</i> attached to
the Court of Hanover, but at that time in Vienna,
and is addressed to Caroline, the Electoral Princess,
whom he had known as a brilliant girl under the
wing of her aunt Sophia Charlotte, sister of George,
at the Court of Berlin.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 6.5em;">“Vienna,</span><br>
“December 16th, 1713.<br>
</p>

<p>“I have not troubled your Highness with letters
since I left Hanover, as I had nothing of interest to
tell you, but I must not neglect the opportunity
which this season gives me of assuring your
Highness of my perpetual devotion, and I pray
God to grant you the same measure of years as the
Electress enjoys, and the same good health. And
I pray also that you may one day enjoy the title of
Queen of England so well worn by Queen Elizabeth
which you so highly merit.</p>

<p>“Consequently, I wish the same good things to
his Highness, your Consort, since you can only
occupy the throne of that great Queen with him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
Whenever the gazettes publish favourable rumours
concerning you and affairs in England, I devoutly
pray that they may become true; sometimes it is
rumoured here that a fleet is about to escort you
both to England, and a powerful alliance is being
formed to support your claims. I have even read
that the Tsar is only strengthening his navy in
order to supply you with Knights of the Round
Table. It is time to translate all these rumours
into action, as our enemies do not sleep. Count
Gallas, who is leaving for Rome in a few days, tells
me that well-informed people in England think that
the first act of the present Tory Ministry will be
to put down the Whigs, the second to confirm
the peace, and the third to change the law of
succession. I hear that in Hanover there is strong
opposition to all this. I hope it may be so with
all my heart.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Princess Caroline’s reply.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 6em;">“Hanover,</span><br>
“December 27th, 1713.<br>
</p>

<p>“I assure you that of all the letters this season
has brought me, yours has been the most welcome.
You do well to send me your good wishes for the
throne of England, which are sorely needed just
now, for in spite of all the favourable rumours you
mention, affairs there seem to be going from bad to
worse. For my part (and I am a woman and like
to delude myself) I cling to the hope that, however
bad things may be now, they will ultimately turn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
to the advantage of our House. I accept the comparison
which you draw, though all too flattering,
between me and Queen Elizabeth as a good omen.
Like Elizabeth, the Electress’s rights are denied her
by a jealous sister with a bad temper<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>, and she will
never be sure of the English crown until her
accession to the throne. God be praised that our
Princess of Wales<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> is better than ever, and by her
good health confounds all the machinations of her
enemies.”</p>
</div>

<p>Poor young Princess Caroline, “the Pure, the
Great, the Illustrious,” as Mr. Wilkins calls her.
She must, but for her children, have found it none
too cheerful in that dreary old Leine Schloss by the
river, about which clung the then unsolved mystery
of the disappearance of Königsmarck, the lover
of the Princess Sophie Dorothea—her husband’s
mother—as he left that lady’s chamber and was
seen no more. A mystery which remained a
mystery until years after when, the floor of an
adjoining room being taken up, his body was found
beneath.</p>

<p>But apart from this it must have been a dreary
life for a young girl, a life of looking on at much
over-eating, and over-drinking perhaps, too. A life
of low sordid immorality going on under her very
nose in which her husband and his father played
leading parts; a life in which the higher side of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
nature was never called upon, except for the almost
habitual display of charity and forbearance to
others.</p>

<p>Yet the higher nature was there despite her
faults which were many; she possessed the pure
gold of a good heart, which saw her through many
trials and temptations, and left her, but for her
conduct to her eldest son—and some of her correspondence—a
clean name in history.</p>

<p>But other more stirring thoughts soon filled the
young mother’s head than the frailties of her
husband’s family, for when the sum of her nursery
reached four and the little Prince Frederick was
in his eighth year, the fruit of her hopes ripened,
Queen Anne of England died, and a lucky turn of
politics in favour of the Whigs, laid open to her the
road to a throne.</p>

<p>On the 18th of June, 1714, the Heiress of
England, the Electress Sophia of Hanover, the aged
mother of that Prince Elector, who afterwards
became George the First of England, and granddaughter
of James the First having dined in public
with her son, that is to say having taken her big
German mid-day meal in the presence of the Court,
went forth on the arm of her granddaughter-in-law,
the Electoral Princess Caroline, to take the summer
air in the beautiful gardens of the Palace of
Herrenhausen.</p>

<p>Much had occurred during the previous twenty-four
hours to upset the “Heiress of Britain” as she
was proud to be called, far too much worry for an
old lady in her eighty-fourth year. Even at that
advanced age the glamour of the English crown
fascinated her. Perhaps it was the long drawn out
hope of many years, the hope that possibly had been
ever before her eyes since the flight of James the
Second.</p>

<p>She had received a letter on the previous day
written by the hand of Queen Anne herself in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
that royal lady had distinctly told her in the most
peremptory manner in answer to a supplication to
that effect, that she objected to have any member
of the Electoral family in her dominions during her
lifetime.</p>

<p>This had been a crushing blow. The old
Electress had schemed, and schemed as she
imagined successfully, to establish her grandson
George Augustus, the Electoral Prince, with his
wife in England. This would have been a masterly
stroke worthy of the universal reputation for policy
of so grand an old lady, and would have been as it
were the planting of one foot on the land she looked
upon as her rightful heritage, but fate and Queen
Anne decided differently. The latter had left no
room for doubt about her intentions. Writing to
her confidant Leibnitz, on the 17th June, the
Electoral Princess Caroline said on the subject of
this letter and others:</p>

<p>“We were in a state of uncertainty here until
yesterday, when a courier arrived from the Queen
with letters for the Electress, the Elector, and the
Electoral Prince, of which I can only say that they
are of a violence worthy of my Lord Bolingbroke.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>It is perfectly certain that Queen Anne had made
herself exceedingly objectionable as even a Queen
can at times, and had not possibly stayed to choose
her words. Be that as it may, she had succeeded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
in entirely upsetting the equanimity of her “good
cousin” the Electress.</p>

<p>The old lady issuing from the Palace, where
possibly she had dined more amply than was
judicious—for she was a great eater—leant on the
arm of her beloved Catherine and harped as ladies of
her age will do on the string of her treatment by
her kinswoman Anne. It is said that she became
greatly excited and walked very fast, as she spoke
of her imagined wrongs. They bent their steps
towards the celebrated orangery, where the Princess
and the attendants with them noticed the Electress
turn very white; then the next moment she fell
forward in a swoon.</p>

<p>The cries of the attendants quickly brought to her
aid her son the Elector who was not far off, and he
placed some <i lang="fr">poudre d’or</i>—evidently a restorative—in
her mouth. But she was beyond the power of
earthly restoratives; she was carried into the
Palace and in the barbarous custom of the time bled,
but very little blood came<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>; she was dead! as the
doctors said, from apoplexy.</p>

<p>Thus did this great Princess, to whom our own
late Queen, Victoria, her descendant, has been so
often likened, miss by a little over six weeks the
great goal of all her long years of ambition, the
throne of England, for Queen Anne died on the 1st
of August following.</p>

<p>It is extraordinary that after the lapse of six<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
generations a descendant so like her should fill that
throne after which she had striven so long and so
wisely for her family.</p>

<p>Her son George was now the “Heir of Britain”
in her place; an heirship which was to very soon
resolve itself into possession, for within a few weeks
began that celebrated crisis in England between
Oxford and Bolingbroke which from the virulence of
the discussions at the Councils absolutely broke
down Queen Anne’s health and killed her.</p>

<p>She departed this life on the 1st of August, 1714,
almost her last intelligible words being of her
brother, the Pretender: “My brother! Oh! my
poor brother. What will become of you?”</p>

<p>On July 31st, Craggs, a creature of the Whig
Government, had been despatched to Hanover to
convey the news that the Queen of England was
dying.</p>

<p>Craggs reached Hanover on August 5th—a
journey then apparently of six days—but his
performance, though accomplished, one can imagine,
with all haste, was entirely eclipsed by that of one
Godike, secretary to Bothmar, the Hanoverian
Envoy to England, who, despatched by his master
on August 1st, the day of the Queen’s death,
arrived at Hanover on the 5th, the same day as
Craggs, and proceeding direct to the Palace of
Herrenhausen, conveyed the news to the Elector
before any of the other messengers from England
arrived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>It was this enterprising Bothmar who really
decided George in accepting the British Crown, for
had not his reports from London been satisfactory
as to the feeling of the people, or at any rate as to
the absence of hostility to the Elector on their part,
it is very unlikely that George would have left his
beloved Herrenhausen at all, and England might
to-day have been ruled by a Stuart King.</p>

<p>“The late King,” wrote Dean Lockier after the
death of George the First, “would never have
stirred a step if there had been any strong opposition.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>But there was no disturbance, the people of
London at any rate were quiet, probably in a state
of expectancy, and the preparations of the Elector
and his family for a move to England commenced
forthwith.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the new King of England did not
hurry himself to take possession of his dominions;
he had been there thirty-four years before on a
matrimonial venture, of which the late Queen Anne,
then Princess of York, was the object, and he
apparently cherished no pleasant recollections of the
visit, which had proved a dismal failure.</p>

<p>However, he started a month after the death of
Queen Anne for the Hague, there to embark for
England, and he took with him a numerous following
of Hanoverians in which was Bernstorff, his Prime
Minister, and two-thirds of his seraglio, <i>i.e.</i>, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
Ladies Schulemburg and Kielmansegge. It is not
surprising that with his Eastern proclivities he took
also a couple of Turks by name Mustapha and
Mahomet, but whether these two last were eunuchs,
in attendance on the two ladies of the harem or not
is not mentioned in history.</p>

<p>To his son, the Electoral Prince, George gave
the command to travel with him, the Princess
Caroline was to follow in a month with all her
children except one. Little Prince Frederick Louis,
the subject of these Memoirs, by his grandfather’s
command, was to remain behind in Hanover, a child
of seven, alone and separated from the rest of his
kindred.</p>

<p>The new King, George the First of England,
having departed with his train, and a month after
the Princess Caroline—soon to become Princess of
Wales—following with all the other children, little
Frederick Louis, then in his eighth year, was left
alone at Herrenhausen under the guardianship of
his great-uncle Ernest Augustus and controlled by
various governors and tutors.</p>

<p>One can imagine the little lonely boy wandering
through the deserted corridors of the Palace of
Herrenhausen and picturing the figures of those
dearest to him, those who had left him and whose
faces he was not to see again for many a long year.
In the early days of that separation one can picture
the child in the orange walks of the beautiful
grounds in the warm autumn time and looking
and longing for his mother—she was a good and
affectionate mother to him then—whose face he
was not to see again for nearly fourteen years.
During the next two years while the excitement of
the Pretender’s invasion was passing in England,
the little Prince lived the ordinary life of a child,
but with the difference from ordinary children that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
he must have been an exceedingly lonely child.
That he was without companions of his own age is
quite certain from what followed. From his great-uncle
it is unlikely that he received much sympathy,
if that Prince partook of the nature of his brother
the King-Elector George. But there was one left
behind there who possibly showed him some kindness—although
there is not a vestige of evidence
to show that she did—and that was the beautiful
Countess Platen, the mistress of the King who was
left behind on account of the religion she professed,
and because Bernstorff, the Hanoverian Prime
Minister, was jealous of her influence over the
King.</p>

<p>So for two years the little Prince lived his child’s
life and nothing was recorded of him. Then we
hear of him from two sources: from Lady Mary
Wortley-Montagu, who visited Hanover in 1716,
like many other English in the train of the King,
and from his governor who reported upon his
conduct to his mother about this time.</p>

<p>The former of these who could be trusted—for
Lady Mary was no Court sycophant and lied to no
one—writes as follows of Frederick:—</p>

<p>“Our young Prince, the Duke of Gloucester”—he
had just received that title from his grandfather,
but the patent never passed the Seal—“has all the
accomplishments which it is possible to have at his
age, with an air of sprightliness and understanding,
and something so very engaging and easy in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
behaviour that he needs not the advantage of his
rank to appear charming. I had the honour of a
long conversation with him last night before the
King came in. His governor retired on purpose,
as he told me afterwards that I might make some
judgment of his genius by hearing him speak
without constraint, and I was surprised by the
quickness and politeness that appeared in everything
that he said, joined to a person perfectly
agreeable, and the fine fair hair of the Princess.”</p>

<p>So much for little Prince Frederick at the age of
nine. It may be here explained that his mother
Caroline, Princess of Wales, had beautiful fair hair
and a lovely skin; she was said also to possess the
finest bust in Europe.</p>

<p>But from the very favourable account of Lady
Mary we have to turn to the other, that of his
governor, and that is far from flattering. Indeed,
in this record we shall be continually turning from
good report to evil report, and from evil report back
again to the good. It will be necessary later to
draw a line and divide the makers of these
reports into two distinct parties, the prejudiced
and interested, the unprejudiced, those who had
nothing to gain by vilifying him.</p>

<p>But on the occasion we refer to, the governor of
the young Prince had a good deal to say; he spoke
with feeling, as one who had suffered, and most
probably he had: he reveals a very pitiable state of
affairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>His complaints were embodied in a letter to
Prince Frederick’s mother, and were as follows; he
was a precocious youth—it must be remembered
he was only nine years old—he already <em>gambled</em> and
<em>drank</em>.</p>

<p>The Princess of Wales, however, made light of
the matter.</p>

<p>“Ah,” she answered, “I perceive that these are
the tricks of a page.”</p>

<p>To which his irate governor responded:</p>

<p>“Plût à Dieu, madame,” he virtuously answered,
“these are not the tricks of a page; these are the
tricks of a lacquey and a rascal!”</p>

<p>It is pretty certain that young as the boy was his
life was developing on the same lines as his father
and grandfather, for which their bad example and
the lonely state in which he lived was undoubtedly
accountable.</p>

<p>George the First, however, when he visited
Hanover in 1716 found no fault with his grandson.
He appears to have been one of the few friends the
boy had. He evidently approved of him in every
way whether he knew of the child’s growing bad
habits or not. He was especially pleased that he
held courts and levees at Herrenhausen in his
absence and as a mark of his general approval
created the boy Duke of Gloucester, but as it has
been already stated the patent never passed the
Seal, probably because the title chosen had proved
a very unlucky one in former cases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p><i lang="la">A propos</i> of this visit of King George to
Hanover—the first since his accession to the
English throne two years before—Lady Mary
Wortley-Montagu writes:—</p>

<p>“This town is neither large nor handsome, but
the palace capable of holding a greater Court than
that of St. James’s. The King has had the kindness
to appoint us a lodging in one part, without
which we should be very ill-accommodated, for the
vast number of English crowds the town so much
it is very good luck to get one sorry room in a
miserable tavern.... The King’s company of
French comedians play here every night; they are
very well dressed, and some of them not ill actors.
His Majesty dines and sups constantly in public.
The Court is very numerous, and its affability and
goodness make it one of the most agreeable places
in the world.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Lady Mary writes again to another friend:</p>

<p>“I have now got into the region of beauty. All
the women have literally rosy cheeks, snowy foreheads
and bosoms; jet eyebrows and scarlet lips,
to which they generally add coal black hair. These
perfections never leave them until the hour of their
deaths, and have a very fine effect by candlelight.
But I could wish them handsome with a little more
variety. They resemble one of the beauties of
Mrs. Salmon’s Court of Great Britain,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and are in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
as much danger of melting away by approaching
too close to the fire, which they for that reason,
carefully avoid, though it is now such excessive cold
weather that I believe they suffer extremely by
that piece of self-denial.”</p>

<p>This bit of satire apparently was directed at the
Hanoverian ladies’ excessive fat.</p>

<p>But Lady Mary was charmed with Herrenhausen.</p>

<p>“I was very sorry,” she writes, “that the ill
weather did not permit me to see Herrenhausen in
all its beauty, but in spite of the snow I think the
gardens very fine. I was particularly surprised at
the vast number of orange trees, much larger than
any I have ever seen in England, though this
climate is certainly colder.”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>It appears from the account in Mr. Wilkins’
“Caroline the Illustrious,” that King George
enjoyed himself immensely during this 1716 visit to
Hanover, and that he found much pleasure in the
society of the beautiful but unscrupulous Countess
Platen, from whom he had been separated for two
years. Lady Mary Montagu herself, too, was not
without favour in His Majesty’s eyes. The King-Elector,
however, had also brought with him the
remainder of the harem, viz., Schulemburg and
Kielmansegge, with the two Turks presumably to
look after them.</p>

<p>Yet with all this trouble around him King<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
George found life pleasurable. In the above
account Lord Peterborough, who was in his suite, is
represented as remarking of him that “he believed
he had forgotten the accident which happened to
him and his family on the 1st August, 1714.”</p>

<p>But time passed on, and the King returned once
more to England, leaving his little nine-year-old
grandson to the tender care, officially, of his brother
Ernest Augustus and his governors, but unofficially
to the society of such grooms and hangers-on of the
palace who could throw themselves, to the boy’s
ruin, in his way.</p>

<p>George the First died on the 10th of June, 1727,
while in a travelling carriage ascending a hill near
Ippenburen on the road to Hanover, of a fit brought
on by a too-free indulgence in melons. These he
unfortunately ate on the previous night while
supping at the house of a local nobleman, the
Count de Twittel.</p>

<p>He was succeeded by his son George, Prince of
Wales, who was born at Hanover the 30th October,
1683, of Sophia, Princess of Luneberg Zell, his
father’s uncrowned Queen. Thus Caroline, the
mother of our Prince Frederick, exchanged her
position of Princess of Wales for that of Queen
of England.</p>

<p>The Princess of Wales had been a success in
England from the very first; a success which was
not to be wondered at if the following description
of her is correct:—</p>

<p>“She still retained her beauty. She was more
than common tall, of majestic presence, she had
an exquisitely-modelled neck and bust, and her
hand was the delight of the sculptor. Her smile
was distinguished by its sweetness and her voice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
was rich and low. Her lofty brow, and clear,
thoughtful gaze showed that she was a woman of
no ordinary mould. She had the royal memory,
and, what must have been a very useful attribute
to her, the power of self-command; she was an
adept in the art of concealing her feelings, of
suiting herself to her company, and of occasionally
appearing to be what she was not. Her love of
art, letters and science, her lively spirits, quick
apprehension of character, and affability were all
points in her favour. She had, too, a love of state,
and appeared magnificently arrayed at Court
ceremonials, evidently delighting in her exalted
position and fully alive to its dignity.”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>To the Princess’s attractions were added those of
her maids of honour: all “Well-born, witty and
beautiful, and not out of their teens.”</p>

<p>First of these, <i lang="la">par excellence</i>, was Mary Bellenden,
daughter of John second Lord Bellenden. To the
fascinating charms of her person which were
undeniable was added an exceedingly lively disposition.
She is thus referred to in an old ballad
dealing with the quarrel between George the First
and the Prince of Wales, when the Prince and all
his household received notice to quit St. James’s:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“But Bellenden we needs must praise</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Who as down the stairs she jumps;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sings over the hills and far away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Despising doleful dumps.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>
<p>She did not escape the unwelcome attentions of the
Prince of Wales to whom sprightly fresh young
English girls were a novelty after the heavy Fraus
of Hanover, though his wife Caroline was certainly
an exception.</p>

<p>It is stated by Coxe in his “Memoirs of Sir
Robert Walpole” that he sent his abominable
propositions to Mary Bellenden by Mrs. Howard,
the before-mentioned “nucleus” of his harem who
had accompanied him to England, and that the
pure-minded Mary very properly snubbed both him
and his messenger—who was nothing more than a
procuress if she really carried the message—for
their pains.</p>

<p>Coxe then states that the Prince being rejected
by Miss Bellenden fell in love with Mrs. Howard,
but he could not, of course, have been aware that
the liaison between the Prince and this lady began
in Hanover.</p>

<p>This seduction or attempted seduction of the
maids of honour appears, as will be seen later, to
have been quite a recognised pastime at Court, in
which the Prince of Wales of the moment took an
active part; but all honour be to sweet Mary
Bellenden who preserved her good name, became
Duchess of Argyle, and handed a pure record down
to posterity.</p>

<p>This young lady appears to have possessed a
particular charm and fascination, both from her
beauty and her sparkling wit and high spirits.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
Horace Walpole states that the palm was awarded
“above all for universal admiration to Miss
Bellenden. Her face and person were charming,
lively she was even to <i lang="fr">étourderie</i>, and so agreeable
that she was never afterwards mentioned by her
contemporaries but as the most perfect creature
they had ever seen.”</p>

<p>Gay, the poet, refers to <i lang="fr">la belle Bellenden</i> more
than once.</p>

</div>

<p>It has been said that this young lady was the
subject of improper advances from the Prince of
Wales, which were rejected. Snubbing, however,
seemed to have but little effect on the Heir-Apparent;
he pressed his attentions upon her in
the following elegant and gentlemanly manner.</p>

<p>Mary Bellenden, like many others who live in the
atmosphere of Courts, suffered almost chronically
from what is called “Living in Short Street”; she
was always hard up.</p>

<p>The refined George being well aware of this, in
common, probably, with most of the household, took
upon himself one evening to sit beside the beautiful
Bellenden, and taking out his purse—one of those
long silk net affairs, no doubt—commenced to count
out his guineas as a gentle hint that he was prepared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
to settle Mary’s outstanding bills—which
may have been particularly pressing at the time—a
<i lang="la">quid pro quo</i> being understood.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="figcenter"  id="img003">

</span></p>
<p class="center caption">MARY BELLENDEN,<br>4th Duchess of Argyll.<br>Copied for this book by the kindness of the present Duke from the
Gallery at Inveraray.</p>

<p>Miss Bellenden bore the telling of his guineas
once, but when he began to count them again she
remonstrated.</p>

<p>“Sir,” she cried, “I cannot bear it; if you count
your money any more, I will go out of the room.”</p>

<p>The delicate-minded George, fresh from the
mercenary and accommodating ladies of Herrenhausen,
was not abashed at this rejoinder; he
jingled his guineas against Mary’s pretty little
ear. The result was exactly what it should have
been. Mary rose with sparkling eyes and cheeks
aflame, and with one well-directed blow, sent his
purse and his guineas flying across the room; then
Mary, probably aghast at her act, ran away.</p>

<p>Another way of showing her contempt of her
royal admirer was to stand with crossed arms in
his presence. Later she wrote on this subject to
Mrs. Howard, with whom she appeared to have
formed a close intimacy; she was recommending a
new maid-of-honour to her care:</p>

<p>“I hope you will put her a little in the way of
behaving before the Princess, such as not turning
her back; and one thing runs mightily in my head,
which is, crossing her arms, <em>as I did to the Prince</em>,
and told him I was not cold but liked to stand
so.”<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>
<p>But Miss Bellenden was in love, which is the
greatest safeguard against such persons as the little
German Prince of Wales. She loved a certain
groom of the bedchamber to the Prince, Colonel
John Campbell, some years later Duke of
Argyle. But here George showed a little of the
<i lang="fr">noblesse</i> which one expects from a descendant of
Edward the Third.</p>

<p>Finding that Mary Bellenden was in love, though
he did not know the object of her affections, he
showed no ill-feeling, but asked a pledge from her
that she would not marry without informing him,
and in return he would give her and her future
husband his favour. But Mary had lived much at
Court, and mistrusted princes.</p>

<p>A year or two later she secretly married Colonel
Campbell, and was no doubt very happy, but
certainly impecunious in that long interval before
she became a Duchess. In 1720 she writes to her
friend Mrs. Howard, from Bath, and good and pure
woman and loving wife though she was, her letter
is a fair sample of the free and easy, not to say
broad, style of even virtuous ladies of the period.</p>

<p>“Oh! God,” she writes, “I am so sick of bills;
for my part I believe I shall never be able to hear
them mentioned without casting up my accounts—bills
are <em>accounts</em> you know. I do not know how
your bills go in London, but I am sure mine are
not dropped, for I paid one this morning as long as
my arm and as broad as my....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>“I intend to send you a letter of attorney, to
enable you to dispose of my goods before I may
leave this place—such is my condition.”</p>

<p>But there were other maids-of-honour only a little
less charming. There was Margaret Bellenden, of
whom Gay wrote.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Mary’s sister or cousin, almost
as beautiful, and Mary Lepel who was raved about
by such excellent critics as Gay, Pope and Voltaire,
not to mention the courtiers Chesterfield and Bath.</p>

<p>She appears to have been of a more stately style
of beauty than Mary Bellenden, and of a more staid
disposition.</p>

<p>Then there was Bridget Carteret, niece of Lord
Carteret, who was fair and <i lang="fr">petite</i>. The oldest of
them all was “prim, pale Margaret Meadows,” who
seems to have done her best to keep them all in
order, but had terrible difficulty with giddy Sophia
Howe, who was the daughter of John Howe by
Ruperta, a natural daughter of Prince Rupert,
brother of the old Electress Sophia, which fact was
probably the reason of her appointment as maid-of-honour
to the Princess of Wales. She was up to all
sorts of mischief, and among other enormities was
given to laughing in church, which is not to be
wondered at when we consider that the King and the
other Royalties were accustomed to talk all the time.</p>

<p>Sophia Howe was, however, reproached for her
laughing by the Duchess of St. Albans, who told
her “she could not do a worse thing.” To this she pertly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
answered—and one can almost hear her
saying it—“I beg your Grace’s pardon, I can do
a great many worse things.”</p>

<p>This conduct of the maids-of-honour—accompanied
by much ogling and smiling at gallants, however,
at last aroused the ire of Bishop Burnet, who
complained to the Princess of Wales, and requested
that their pew should be <em>boarded up</em> so that
they could not see over. This from the Bishops
importunity being at last done, provoked the
following verses in retaliation from one of the young
ladies’ admirers, supposed to be Lord Peterborough:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>
<p>It is not surprising to find that during the reign
of George the First his mistresses Schulemburg and
Kielmansegge were much in evidence. They were
particularly hated by the populace, also the Turks
Mustapha and Mahomet, possibly on account of
their association with them; but these latter
infidels also appear to have had the honour of
dressing and undressing their master the King.</p>

<p>The Court of George the First had not by any
means been a refined one; the old King greatly
loved the society of ladies who were not over
particular in their conversation.</p>

<p>The following, taken from Mr. Wilkins’ “Caroline,”
will illustrate this. Lady Cowper, who was extremely
proper, writes of an entertainment at
Court:</p>

<p>“Though I was greatly diverted and there was
a good deal of music, yet I could not avoid being
uneasy at the repetition of some words in French
which the Duchess of Bolton said by mistake,
which convinced me that the two foreign ladies”
(presumably Schulemburg and Kielmansegge) “were
no better than they should be.”</p>

<p>It appears that the Court of this King was
graced or disgraced by the presence of many such
ladies. One night three mistresses of former Kings
met there: the Duchess of Portsmouth, the particular
lady of Charles the Second; Lady Orkney,
who occupied a similar position with regard to
William the Third; and old Lady Dorchester, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
favourite of James the Second. The latter was
evidently a lady to her finger tips.</p>

<p>“Who!” she exclaimed, “would have thought
that we three w...s should have met here?”</p>

<p>Of the Duchess of Bolton, who was a lady also
rather free of speech, the following anecdote is
related.</p>

<p>She was very fond of the play, and recommending
anything especially good to the old King. On this
occasion she was telling him of Colley Cibber’s
“Love’s Last Shift,” the title of which conveyed
nothing to His Majesty. He asked her to put it
into French. The Duchess, who was fond of a joke,
replied gravely: “<i lang="fr">La dernière chemise de l’ amour</i>,”
whereat the King laughed heartily.</p>

<p>The lovely Duchess of Shrewsbury was another
of the King’s favourite companions, of whom the
prim Lady Cowper—herself much admired by His
Majesty, who did not always express his admiration
in the most refined terms—said as follows:</p>

<p>“Though she had a wonderful art of entertaining
and diverting people, would sometimes exceed the
bounds of decency.”</p>

<p>But as it has been before stated, the favourites of
the King who excited the most resentment of the
populace—who were very free in expressing their
opinion—were Schulemburg and Kielmansegge.</p>

<p>On one occasion Schulemburg was so beset by the
crowd that she ventured to argue with them, and
thrust her red wig and painted face out of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
coach to address them in the best English she had.</p>

<p>“Goot pipple,” she exclaimed, “what for you
abuse us, we come for all your goots?”</p>

<p>“Yes, d..n ye,” added a man in the mob, “and
for all our chattels, too.”</p>

<p>When the Duke of Somerset, in 1715, resigned
the Mastership of the Horse as a protest against
the arrest of his son-in-law, Sir William Wyndham,
Schulemburg, who was nothing if not a daughter of
the horse-leech, suggested that the office should be
left vacant and the salary, £7,500 per annum, paid
to her. To the disgust of the nation the King
complied with her wish.</p>

<p>It does not say much for the dignity of the
Court in those days that some of the leading
Whig nobility and even their wives and daughters
filled the rooms of these two old harridans at St
James’s, which apartments were placed respectively
at opposite ends of the Palace, with those of the
King conveniently between them to keep peace, for
they hated each other as much as their friend the
Devil detests holy water.</p>

<p>The lives of the Prince and Princess of Wales had
been exceedingly gay, especially during the absence
of George the First in Hanover.</p>

<p>They extended a liberal hospitality, keeping
almost open house, with the object no doubt of
securing popularity against the time when they
should be King and Queen.</p>

<p>Hampton Court appears to have been a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
favourite summer residence of theirs, the river
offering a convenient mode of progression. In the
summer of 1716 they proceeded to Hampton Court
in state barges hung with crimson and gold, and
preceded by a band of music.</p>

<p>Here at this riverside Palace they collected a
brilliant throng of the wittiest, the most learned,
and most important of all from the point of view of
a Court, the most beautiful.</p>

<p>At the death of George the First the kingdom
was ruled by his minister, Sir Robert Walpole, son
of a Norfolk squire, Walpole of Houghton, to which
estate they had in comparatively recent years
removed from Walpole in the Marshland of
Norfolk, from which latter place they evidently
had originally derived their name.</p>

<p>George the First being able to speak little or no
English, and Sir Robert Walpole being innocent of
French, Latin proved to be the only tongue in
which they could converse, so that Walpole was in
the habit of remarking that he governed the
kingdom by means of bad Latin, the bad Latin
possibly of his Eton days, though he certainly
completed his education at King’s College, Cambridge.</p>

<p>At about the age of twenty-five Walpole had
married a beautiful girl, Catherine, daughter of
John Shorter, Esquire, of Bybrook, Kent, and very
soon after succeeding his father, old hard-drinking
Squire Walpole, in the family estate he entered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
Parliament for the rotten borough of Castle Rising,
which used to return two members to Parliament
to half-a-dozen electors.</p>

<p>He soon made a name in the House of Commons,
and from that time forward it was indelibly stamped
upon the politics of England.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Walpole was much given to wine
and women, despite his beautiful wife; in fact, she
was not far behind him on her part in receiving
the attentions of the opposite sex. She is said to
have had liaisons with Lord Hervey, and also with
the little Prince of Wales, adding one more to his
long list of “<i lang="fr">foiblesses</i>.” It is almost incredible to
believe, as it has been stated, that Robert Walpole
lent himself to this intrigue of his wife’s to curry
favour with the Prince.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, it stood him in poor stead
on the death of George the First, for when he
presented himself to the new King, who was at the
time at the Palace of Richmond, and having broken
the news of the old King’s death and kissed hands,
asked who should draw up the declaration to the
Privy Council, he was abruptly told by the new
monarch to go to Sir Spencer Compton, who was his
treasurer as Prince of Wales.</p>

<p>It was not until after some days of very painful
suspense that Walpole, through the good offices of
the new Queen, Caroline, who had a great belief
in his talents as a financier, was sent for and reappointed
First Lord Commissioner of the Treasury<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
and Chancellor of the Exchequer. As a matter of
fact of course they could not do without him.</p>

<p>But in all the years that passed from the accession
of the Hanoverian dynasty in 1714 to the death of
George the First, in 1727, it is almost incredible to
believe that Caroline could have forgotten her first-born
son in Hanover, whom at this time she had not
seen for thirteen years.</p>

<p>Whatever the origin of the dislike—nay hatred—was
which unnaturally grew up between this son
and his parents, it must have begun at an early
period. Its nature will now be never known in
all probability, but it must have been a most
extraordinary revulsion of feeling which caused
such a woman as Caroline, kind-hearted, intellectual,
in every other respect a perfect mother, to
turn against the first child she had held to her
bosom.</p>

<p>Some say that Caroline’s affection had been
absorbed by her younger son William, Duke of
Cumberland, who was born in England, and who
extraordinarily resembled her, and this theory
takes colour when considering the fact that the
Prince and Princess up to the time of his birth had
continually urged George the First to allow Prince
Frederick to come to England, but after the arrival
of the new Prince no further requests were made in
this direction, but all their hopes and ambitions
for the future seemed centred in Prince William, for
whom it is said they would gladly have secured the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
throne of England if they had been able, leaving the
Electorate of Hanover for Frederick.</p>

<p>It was very unnatural, but such freaks do occur,
though they do not reflect any honour upon those
by whom they are affected, but even this answer
would be no solution to the question of the reason
for the deep-seated hatred for their eldest son which
took possession of King George the Second and his
Queen at a later period. It will ever remain a
mystery.</p>

<p>Lord Hervey, with a great deal of parade, affected
to be in possession of the secret, and left certain
directions to those who came after him about its
disclosure in his papers, but it is very difficult to
believe that this nobleman was cognizant of the
reason which caused a father and mother—the
latter certainly of an affectionate nature—to turn
against a child of nine.</p>

<p>The reason probably lies far deeper.</p>

<p>But if Prince Frederick was forgotten by his
father and mother, he was certainly not overlooked
by the English people.</p>

<p>“Clamours,” it was said soon after the accession
of George the Second, “were justly raised in
England that the Heir-Apparent had received a
foreign education and was detained abroad as if to
keep alive an attachment to Hanover in preference
to Great Britain.</p>

<p>“The Ministers at length ventured to remonstrate
with the King on the subject, and the Privy Council<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
formally represented the propriety of his residence
in England.”<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>George the Second, however, and his Queen—who
with Walpole really ruled the kingdom—stuck out
as long as they possibly could against bringing
Prince Frederick over, and in the King’s case there
was an additional reason for obstinacy. He had
been a most undutiful son himself, and realised
what an exceedingly sharp thorn in his side
Frederick might become if he took that same line
also.</p>

<p>But while the King and Queen were trying to
make up their minds to send for their first-born,
certain events occurred in Hanover which materially
hastened their decision.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br><span class="small"><span class="smcap">A Double Event Which Did Not Come Off.</span></span></h2></div>


<p>In the reign of George the First there had
commenced an important negotiation between that
King and Frederick William, King of Prussia,
having for its object the union of the two royal
houses by a double marriage, Prince Frederick
Louis, King George’s grandson, was to wed with
Wilhelmina, the Princess Royal of Prussia; the
Prince Royal of Prussia was to marry the Princess
Amelia, sister of Prince Frederick, afterwards
Frederick the Great.</p>

<p>This arrangement had been most eagerly fostered
by Sophia Dorothy, daughter of George the First,
who had espoused the King of Prussia; the negotiations
had reached such a successful stage that King
George had promised that the nuptials of his
grandson with the Princess Wilhelmina should be
celebrated at his next visit to Hanover, but his
death had prevented the fulfilment of his promise.</p>

<p>There had also been another reason which had
tended to delay the marriage, and this had been
the sudden secession of King Frederick William of
Prussia from the Treaty of Hanover, and this had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
greatly offended his father-in-law, King George of
England.</p>

<p>Other obstacles cropped up, too, at the accession
of George the Second, who had, from his earliest
years, conceived an intense dislike for his cousin,
the Prussian King. This was the subject of a most
intense regret on Queen Sophia Dorothy’s part,
who had schemed for the union of her daughter
Wilhelmina with Prince Frederick for years.</p>

<p>As for Prince Frederick himself, there is little
doubt that although he had never seen her, yet he
had in a romantic way fallen in love with his cousin
Wilhelmina. This was quite a natural phase of his
sanguine, artistic character. One can quite understand
that his aunt, the Queen of Prussia, had not
neglected any of those little manœuvres by which
the hearts of young men are moved. She was
simply a match-making mother, and was quite
cognizant of the fact that Frederick would, if he
lived, inherit the Crown of England.</p>

<p>In addition, there was another very strong reason
why she should use every endeavour to get her two
children settled and away, and that was the extreme
brutality of their father, the Prussian King, towards
them, who even did not scruple to beat them
severely.</p>

<p>If, however, Prince Frederick had fallen in love
with the Princess Wilhelmina’s miniature—no doubt
the Prussian Queen saw that he had a good one—the
Princess, if her Memoirs are to be believed, had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
conceived no passion for him, but against this she
certainly showed feeling when the <i lang="fr">dénouement</i> came,
as women will when they lose a lover.</p>

<p>Her mother had argued with her as to the
advantages of the match, as no doubt royal mothers
will:</p>

<p>“He is a good-natured Prince,” she urged, “kind-hearted,
but very foolish; if you have sense enough
to tolerate his mistresses, you will be able to do
what you like with him.”</p>

<p>This art of “tolerating mistresses” seems to be
an accomplishment which has been much sought
after both by ancient and modern Queens. But
this was hardly the kind of argument to foster a
romantic passion; yet, on the other hand, Frederick
had not exactly constituted himself by reputation
the perfect lover.</p>

<p>Left alone in Hanover, almost in regal state, as it
was understood there, for he held all the Levees and
Courts in the absence of his grandfather, he had
run very wild, which was no more than could have
been expected under the circumstances.</p>

<p>But for the periodical visits of his grandfather
from England, Frederick seems to have been left
very much to himself, and with such brilliant
examples before him as his father and grandfather,
it is not at all to be wondered at that he had
mistresses and made a fool of himself generally.</p>

<p>He appears, however, to have been very good
friends with his grandfather, King George, and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
have taken his part against his father and mother
in the quarrels which arose between them and
which formed one of the principal scandals of the
Court of St. James’s. This conduct on his part did
not tend to endear him to his parents, but no doubt
he felt himself aggrieved at being left so long
neglected in Hanover, and, in addition, he only
heard his grandfather’s version of the quarrels.</p>

<p>Prince Frederick then being turned twenty-one,
and imagining himself to be passionately in love
with his cousin Wilhelmina, could ill brook the
diplomatic delays of his father and grandfather.</p>

<p>It must have been a heavy blow to his hopes
when the latter died on his way to Hanover,
and his promise to have the nuptials of Frederick
and Wilhelmina celebrated on his arrival of course
fell to the ground. Neither did his successor,
George the Second, seem at all in a hurry to have
the marriage solemnized, and the delay to a young
man of Frederick’s temperament must have been
very galling.</p>

<p>It is not at all surprising, therefore, that after
waiting more than a year after the death of George
the First, he took the matter into his own hands.
He determined to get married to his cousin without
consulting anyone. For this purpose he contrived
an elaborate scheme, and eventually despatched to
Berlin a certain trusty Hanoverian officer named
La Motte or La Mothe.</p>

<p>This man was charged with a mission to a certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
Sastot, a chamberlain of the Queen of Prussia, and
probably one who had acted as an agent for her in
this matter before. The story cannot be better
given than in the very words of the young lady
herself, Princess Wilhelmina, as recorded in her
diary. La Motte made his appearance at the house
of Sastot, and communicated to him the following
intelligence:</p>

<p>“I am the bearer of a most important confidential
message. You must hide me somewhere in your
house that my arrival may remain unknown, and
you must manage that one of my letters reaches the
King.”</p>

<p>Sastot promised, but asked if his business were
good or evil.</p>

<p>“It will be good if people can hold their tongues,”
replied La Motte, “but if they gossip it will be
evil. However, as I know you are discreet, and as I
require your help in obtaining an interview with the
Queen, I must confide all to you.</p>

<p>“The Prince Frederick Louis intends being here
in three weeks at the latest. He means to escape
secretly from Hanover, brave his father’s anger,
and marry the Princess.”</p>

<p>Surely this was a most romantic proposal for the
good Sastot to listen to!</p>

<p>“He has entrusted me,” proceeded La Motte,
“with the whole affair, and has sent me here to
find out if his arrival would be agreeable to the
King and Queen, and if they are still anxious for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
this marriage. If she is capable of keeping a
secret, and has no suspicious people about her,
will you undertake to speak to the Queen on the
subject?”</p>

<p>That very night the Chamberlain Sastot went to
the Queen and confided the weighty secret to her
as he had promised La Motte.</p>

<p>To the Queen, who had been scheming for years
for this very object, Sastot could not well have
brought better news.</p>

<p>“I shall at length see you happy and my wishes
realized at the same time; how much joy at once.”</p>

<p>Such are the words which the Princess Wilhelmina
records of her mother when breaking the news
to her.</p>

<p>But the Princess, according to her own account,
was by no means overjoyed at the intelligence:</p>

<p>“I kissed her hands,” says Wilhelmina, “which
I covered with tears!”</p>

<p>“You are crying!” my mother exclaimed, “what
is the matter?”</p>

<p>Here Wilhelmina becomes a little double-faced.</p>

<p>“I would not disturb her happiness,” she writes,
“so I answered:</p>

<p>“The thought of leaving you distresses me more
than all the crowns of the world could delight me.</p>

<p>“The Queen was only the more tender towards
me in consequence, and then left me. I loved this
dear mother truly, and had only spoken the truth
to her,” she continues, “she left me in a terrible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
state of mind. I was cruelly torn between my
affection for her and my repugnance for the Prince,
but I determined to leave all to Providence, which
should direct my ways.” Very pious of the
Princess indeed!</p>

<p>The Queen, however, went on her way rejoicing,
knowing, perhaps, rather more of her daughter’s
disposition and therefore troubling less about her
tears.</p>

<p>She was evidently brimming over with high
spirits at the Reception which she held that very
evening, a most unlucky Reception for her schemes
as it turned out. This excellent match-making
aunt of Prince Frederick was fated to suffer a
terrible disappointment that evening. In a burst
of almost incredible confidence she told Bourguait,
the English Envoy, the whole plan of Prince
Frederick!</p>

<p>The Envoy was astounded at the communication,
and asked if it were true.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied the Queen, “and to show
you how true it is, he has sent La Motte here, who
has already informed the King of everything.”</p>

<p>“Oh, why does Your Majesty tell me this? I am
wretched, for I must prevent it!” exclaimed
Bourguait.</p>

<p>“Why?” asked the dismayed Queen.</p>

<p>“Because I am my Sovereign’s Envoy; because
my office requires of me that I should inform him of
so important a matter. I shall send off a messenger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
to England this very evening. Would to God I
had known nothing of all this!”</p>

<p>He was as good as his word, and the messenger
went off that night despite the Queen’s tears.</p>

<p>A good strong man this Bourguait; one not to be
moved from his duty by even a Queen, for she no
doubt left no stone unturned to divert him from a
purpose which would render abortive her years of
scheming.</p>

<p>The effects of the message to England were startling.</p>

<p>King George the Second and his Queen Caroline,
who had kept their eldest son away from England
for fourteen years, and had resisted every persuasion
of their Ministers to bring him over, hesitated no
longer; a Colonel Lorne was despatched at once to
Herrenhausen to bring the Prince to London. He
lost no time on the journey, and appeared at
Herrenhausen while a ball given by Prince
Frederick was in progress. This function, however,
interfered in no way with Colonel Lorne’s
commands; he induced the Prince to leave
Herrenhausen that very night with but one
attendant, and Frederick turned his back upon a
home which had sheltered him for many years,
although it was in a sense no home at all, and in
this life saw it no more.</p>

<p>But when the news of the King of England’s coup
and the departure of the Prince reached Berlin, the
Royal Palace became no fit place for Christians to
live in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>The Queen took to her bed, and the Princess
Wilhelmina, like other young ladies when they lose
their lovers, fainted away, only to come to, apparently
and write in her diary “the whole thing was a plot
of George the Second,” which sounds very much like
the remark of an angry and disappointed young
lady, instead of one who wished us to believe that
she was inspired with repugnance for Prince
Frederick.</p>

<p>Her father, the King, however, who was in a
towering rage at the course events had taken, was
evidently not in the habit of wasting a good fit of
temper on mere fuming. He appeared on the scene
and soundly thrashed both Wilhelmina and her
brother Frederick, Mr. Wilkins says, “in a
shocking manner.”</p>

<p>And the double marriage scheme ended thus
ignominiously!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br><span class="small"><span class="smcap">The Prince and the London of 1728.</span></span></h2></div>


<p>Prince Frederick, accompanied by Colonel Lorne
and a single servant, traversed Germany and
Holland as a private gentleman, and embarked at
Helvetsluis for England in the first days of
December, 1728.</p>

<p>Never has a tamer arrival of an Heir-apparent
been chronicled in history than this coming of the
Prince to London. Here is the brief notice of it in
the <i>Daily Post</i> of the 8th December, 1728:</p>

<p>“Yesterday His Royal Highness Prince Frederick
came to Whitechapel about seven in the evening,
and proceeded thence privately in a hackney coach
to St. James’s. His Royal Highness alighted at the
Friary, and walked down to the Queen’s backstairs,
and was there conducted to Her Majesty’s apartment.”</p>

<p>There! no reception of any sort, no guards
turning out, no escort, no tap of drum! It was
more like the coming of the Court hairdresser to
curl Her Majesty’s wig!</p>

<p>It is said, however, that his mother received him
amiably,—after fourteen years’ separation! His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
father, however, treated him with great harshness.
“George,” says Mr. Wilkins, “had an unnatural
and deep-rooted aversion to his eldest son, whom he
regarded as necessarily his enemy.”</p>

<p>Certainly the boy—for he was little more—had
come home in a sort of disgrace, he had been
detected in scheming to run away with a young
lady, but he had been checkmated, and the matter
was ended. Certainly if there grew up in the
after time a feeling of resentment against his parents
in the Prince’s heart, he had some reason for it. It
is agreed on all hands that he never had a chance,
and that which might have proved a loving nature—and
it <em>was</em> a loving nature as will be shown later
on—was warped by ill-treatment and neglect into
callousness and depravity.</p>

<p>To a Prince naturally of a nervous and shy disposition
this reception in a strange land must have
been most painful, especially when one remembers
that most of the slights were received from those
who ought to have shown him the most affection
and consideration.</p>

<p>Lord Hervey gives an insight into the kind of
life he led when he first arrived. He says:</p>

<p>“Whenever the Prince was in the room with him
(<i>i.e.</i>, the King) it put one in mind of stories that
one has heard of ghosts that appear to part of
the company but are invisible to the rest; and in
this manner, wherever the Prince stood, though the
King passed him ever so often, or ever so near, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
always seemed as if the King thought the Prince
filled a void of space.”</p>

<p>According to Mr. Wilkins, “the Prince did not
dine in public at St. James’s the Sunday after his
arrival, but the Queen <em>suffered him</em> to hand her into
her pew at the Chapel Royal, and this was his first
appearance at the English Court.”</p>

<p>One can imagine those naughty maids-of-honour
in their boarded-up pew in the gallery—perhaps
poor Anne Vane there with them—saying anything
but their prayers at their enclosed condition, which
prevented them having a good look at the Prince.
But if they did happen to catch a glimpse of him
this is what they saw according to a contemporary
letter of Lady Bristol, who describes him as “the
most agreeable young man it is possible to imagine,
without being the least handsome, his person little,
but very well made and genteel, a loveliness in his
eyes which is indescribable, and the most obliging
address that can be conceived.”</p>

<p>Her account of him, however, falls far short of that
which is generally accepted as being a description
of his appearance in Smollett’s “Peregrine Pickle,”
which depicts him at a Court ball; but as this was
evidently some time after his arrival—as it is an
event connected with his intrigue with Miss Vane—it
is quite likely that he may have had time to add
to his stature by natural growth. At a later period
he was distinctly and creditably described as being
tall. This is Smollett’s version:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>“He was dressed in a coat of white cloth, faced
with blue satin embroidered with silver, of the same
piece with his waistcoat; his fine hair hung down
his back in ringlets below his waist; his hat was
laced with silver and garnished with a white
feather; but his person beggared all description:
he was tall and graceful, neither corpulent nor
meagre, his limbs finely proportioned, his countenance
open and majestic, his eyes full of sweetness
and vivacity, his teeth regular, and his pouting
lips of the complexion of the damask rose. In short,
he was formed for love and inspired it wherever he
appeared; nor was he a niggard of his talents, but
liberally returned it, at least what passed for such;
for he had a flow of gallantry for which many ladies
of this land can vouch from their own experience.”</p>

<p>It must be remembered in reading above description
of him, that he inherited his mother’s
beautiful fair hair and complexion.</p>

<p>The Court poets were not behindhand with their
fulsome verses concerning him, of which this is a
sample:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Fresh as a rosebud newly blown and fair</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As opening lilies: on whom every eye</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With joy and admiration dwells. See, see,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He rides his docile barb with manly grace.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is it Adonis for the chase arrayed?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or Britain’s second hope?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Britain’s first hope apparently was George II.</p>

<p>But probably as regards his appearance when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
first came to England, Lady Bristol was nearest the
mark, though there is no doubt that from this time
forward he steadily improved both in stature and
in handsomeness of person. Another description of
him which will appear in due course will give an
idea of the dignity and stateliness to which he
attained in his maturer years.</p>

<p>Prince Frederick came from the obscure old town
of Hanover with its narrow streets and tall gabled
houses to what was then, as it is now, one of
the great capitals of the world, London. But yet
a very different London to that of our own time. A
London of streets narrow and paved with cobbles,
unlit save for a few dim swinging oil lamps held
across the streets by ropes, leaving the intervening
spaces in darkness, so that in winter time a man
with a link or torch was an absolute necessity.</p>

<p>The busy London, the shopping London lay
principally between Fleet Street and the end
of Cheapside. Ludgate Hill was an especially
favourite place for dress-buying ladies. As for
what we call the “West End” it did not exist,
Westminster being a separate town, and between it
and London City large expanses of waste land.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilkins gives a good account of the Court
and its environs. He says:</p>

<p>“The political and fashionable life of London
collected round St. James’s and the Mall. St.
James’s Park was the fashionable promenade; it
was lined with avenues of trees, and ornamented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
with a long canal and a duck pond. St. James’s
Palace was much as it is now, and old Marlborough
House (the residence at that time of Sarah, Duchess
of Marlborough) occupied the site of the present
one; but on the site of Buckingham Palace stood
Buckingham House, the seat of the powerful Duke
of Buckingham, a stately mansion which the Duke
had built in a ‘little wilderness full of blackbirds
and nightingales.’ In St. James’s Street were
the most frequented and fashionable coffee and
chocolate houses, and also a few select ‘mug houses.’
Quaint signs, elaborately painted, carved and gilded,
overhung the streets and largely took the place of
numbers; houses were known as ‘The Blue Boar,’
‘The Pig and Whistle,’ ‘The Merry Maidens,’ ‘The
Red Bodice,’ and so forth.”</p>

<p>Piccadilly was practically a country road with a
few mansions here and there. It ended in Hyde
Park, then a wild heath.</p>

<p>Marylebone on the west, and Stepney on the
east, were distinct villages some distance away;
while as for the south, London appears to have
ended at London Bridge, although the “Old
Tabard” Inn in the Borough must certainly have
existed at that time.</p>

<p>Bloomsbury, Soho and Seven Dials were fashionable
suburbs, occupying, perhaps, much the same
position as Kensington did fifty years ago.
Grosvenor Square had been begun some twelve
years, and was probably fairly covered by houses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>The most popular and agreeable mode of communication
between London and the Court was by
the Thames, and a stately barge with liveried
rowers was as much a part of a nobleman’s equipment
as his carriage or his “chair.” Very pretty
must have been the appearance of the Thames at
that time, although there was no Thames Embankment
to view it from.</p>

<p>The streets at night were manifestly unsafe,
being infested by a description of drunken young
blackguards known as “Mohocks,” who apparently
“squared” the equally drunken watchmen, and
insulted women with impunity.</p>

<p>The public conveyance seems to have been of
much the same description as that which one
recollects in one’s youth in the shape of the ancient
growler, musty and full of damp straw to keep the
feet warm, but represented then by a rumbling old
disused coach, very mouldy, with straw as above,
and in which it must have been a great treat to
traverse the irregular cobbles of the metropolitan
streets. But with all its drawbacks London of
1728 rose immeasurably superior to London of the
twentieth century in one respect, and one respect
only. It had no fogs.</p>

<p>The streets apparently rang with more or less
agreeable cries of itinerant traders, among which the
still familiar cry of the milkman—or perhaps milk-girl—and
the tinkle of the muffin bell must even
then have been well established. There were,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
however, other street cries which are unknown to
us in the present day, those of the professional
rat-catcher and the street gambler, which latter
apparently stood in the gutter and rattled a dice-box
as an invitation to passers by to come and have
a throw, an invitation which, in all probability,
ended in disaster to the unwary who accepted it.</p>

<p>Drunkenness, too, was very rife among all classes,
the following inscription on a public-house being a
fair sample of the tastes of the people:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Drunk for one penny.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dead drunk for two pence.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Clean straw for nothing.”<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As regards the time for meals in fashionable
circles in those days, there was really little difference
between those times and our own except that the
meals were called by different names.</p>

<p>Dinner was taken in the middle of the day or a
little later, which would very well correspond to our
luncheon. As for the afternoon, why ladies of
quality did very much the same then as they do
now; they were trotted about in their sedan-chairs
or coaches from one friend’s house to another
drinking “dishes” of tea at each and destroying
their nervous systems just as they do in 1911.
Supper was the most pleasant meal of the day, and
might well be set down to correspond with the very
late dinner hour of the fashionable world at the
present time.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>
<p>So the world—the <i lang="fr">beau monde</i> at any rate—has
gone on for nearly two hundred years with but
very little variation in its feeding time at any rate.</p>

<p>Very much the same might be said of the life in
St. James’s Street as it is lived at the present time.
There was no electric light, but the scene must have
been very much more brilliant especially at night.
The men-about-town of those days dressed in silks,
satins, and velvets of varied colours, heavily laced
with gold. Their sword hilts were either of gold or
silver and very often jewelled. They carried in
their hands long canes frequently jewelled too, and
to add to the stateliness of their appearance they
either wore white wigs or had their own hair
powdered. The coffee and chocolate houses of
St. James’s Street of those days, when full of their
patrons, must have presented scenes worth looking
upon. White’s Chocolate House was the principal,
and the Cocoa Tree its rival, both represented at
the present time by clubs of almost identical names.
Of clubs, as we understand them, there were none
in the year 1728, if we except such as the “October
Club” and the “Hell Fire Club,” the former
composed of old Jacobite squires who probably met
at an inn, and the latter the drunken desecrators of
Medmenhain Abbey on the Thames, neither of
which societies had a club house as we understand
it.</p>

<p>As for the ladies, they outrivalled the sterner
sex, as they should do, in the splendour of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
attire. They wore powder, patches and hoops—the
latter a revival apparently of Elizabeth’s day—which
grew in size with the progression of the Georges,
until fashion took a sudden revulsion in the days of
the last, and left them off altogether, which was
considered at the time highly indelicate.</p>

<p>In the earlier period referred to ladies did not
scruple to walk abroad with their dresses even more
than <i lang="fr">decolletée</i>, a custom which possibly was not
long persevered in on account of the climate.
Ladies of the present day will rejoice to hear that
enormous muffs were carried.</p>

<p>To sum up this topic so interesting to the softer
sex, ladies at that time wore just as many furs and
feathers, silks and satins, jewels and fine laces, as
they do at the present day, and the craving after
them, the debts incurred in their procuring, wrought
them, possibly, quite as much harm, and were the
cause, no doubt, of just as many broken marriage
vows.</p>

<p>The world is very much the same at all times,
except that now and then we take on a little extra
enamel, which we call civilization, to hide our
natural barbarism for a time, as the Greeks and
the Romans and the Egyptians before them did—these
latter even to having their hollow teeth gold-crowned
as we do—until some upheaval from within,
or a crushing blow from without, breaks the thin
crust, and leaves us just the natural savages we

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.<br><span class="small"><span class="smcap">Peter Wentworth’s Letters on the Prince’s Life.</span></span></h2></div>


<p>Floating in and out of English history of this
period are the letters of a person who apparently
was furnished by Providence to write tittle-tattle of
his times for the information of posterity. These
are the letters of the Honourable Peter Wentworth,
mostly addressed to his brother, Lord Strafford,
but others to his sister-in-law, Lady Strafford. To
these we have to look for the first little insights into
the Prince’s life in England.</p>

<p>Through the insistence of the Privy Council, not
of the King’s own freewill, Frederick had been
created Prince of Wales soon after his arrival in
England, but the King had made no provision for
him, although £100,000 per annum of the King’s
income—he received no less than £900,000 a year
from the country—had been earmarked for the
Prince’s use, subject to his father’s pleasure. He
preferred to keep him in the Palace like his other
younger children, and under very much the same
restrictions. The young Prince of Wales appears
at this time to have had a good friend in his
mother, even if she had forgotten her natural love
for him. It was she who urged the King to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
provide a separate establishment for him becoming
his rank, even going as far as to look at a house for
him in George Street, Hanover Square, but her
solicitations produced no effect whatever upon the
King, who would not make him any sufficient
allowance. So Frederick, though over twenty-two,
and Prince of Wales, had to remain at his mother’s
apron strings.</p>

<p>He appears, however, at this time to have lived
on very pleasant terms with the Queen, and to have
steadily grown in the public favour. He had
learned English in Hanover, and spoke it fairly well
on his arrival in this country.</p>

<p>In a letter dated July 28th, 1729—a few months
after the Prince’s coming—written by Mr. Peter
Wentworth to Lord Strafford, his brother, we get a
little glimpse of what the Prince’s life was like at
this time.</p>

“Kensington.<br>
</p>

<p>“I have been at Richmond again with the Queen
and the Royal Family, and I thank God they are all
very well. We are going there to-day, and the
Queen walks about there all day long. I shall be
no longer her jest as a lover of drink at free cost,
not only from her own observation of one whom she
sees every morning at eight o’clock and in the
evening again at seven, walking in the gardens, and
in the drawing-room until after ten, but because she
has, my Lord Lifford<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> to play upon, who this day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
sen’night got drunk at Richmond. His manner of
getting so was pleasant enough, he dined with my
good Lord Grantham, who is well served at his
table with meat, but very stingy and sparing in his
drink, for as soon as his dinner is done, he and his
company rise, and no round of toasts. So my lord
made good use of his time whilst at dinner, and
before they rose the Prince (of Wales) came to them
and drunk a <i lang="fr">bonpère</i> to my Lord Lifford, which he
pledged, and began another to him, and so a third.</p>

<p>“The Duke of Grafton, to show the Prince he
had done his business, gave him (Lord Lifford) a
little shove and threw him off his chair upon the
ground, and then took him up and carried him to
the Queen.</p>

<p>“Sunday morning she railed at him before all the
Court upon getting drunk in her company, and
upon his gallantry and coquetry with Princess
Amelia, running up and down the steps with her.
When somebody told him the Queen was there and
saw him, his answer was: ‘What do I care for the
Queen?’</p>

<p>“He stood all her jokes not only with French
impudence, but with Irish assurance. For all you
say I don’t wonder I blushed for him, and wished
for half his stock. I wonder at her making it so
public.</p>

<p>“Nobody has made a song; if Mr. Hambleton
will make one that shall praise the Queen and the
Royal Family’s good humour, and expose as much as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
he pleases the folly of Lord Grantham and Lord
Lifford, I will show it to the Prince, and I know he
won’t tell whom he had it from, for I have lately
obliged him with a sight of <i>Mrs. Fitzwilliam’s
Litany</i>; and he has promised he will not say he
had it from me. So I must beg you to say nothing
of this to Lady Strafford, for she will write it for
news to Lady Charlotte Roussie, and then I shall
have Mrs. Fitz. angry with me, and the Prince
laughing at me for not being able to be my own
counsellor, as I fear you laugh now. But if you
betray me, I make a solemn vow I will never tell
you anything again.</p>

<p>“The Queen continues very kind and obliging in
her sayings to me, and gave me t’other day an
opportunity to tell her of my circumstances. As we
were driving by Chelsea, she asked me what that
walled place was called. I told her Chelsea Park,
and in the time of the Bubbles ’twas designed for
the Silkworms.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> She asked me if I was not in the
Bubbles. With a sigh I answered: ‘Yes; that and
my fire had made me worse than nothing.’ Some
time after, when I did not think she saw me, I was
biting my nails. She called to me and said: ‘Oh,
fie! Mr. Wentworth, you bite your nails very
prettily.’ I begged her pardon for doing so in her
presence, but I said I did it for vexation of my
circumstances, and to save a crown from Dr. Lamb
for cutting them. She said she was sorry I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
anything to vex me, and I did well to save my
money. The Prince told her I was one of the most
diligent servants he ever saw. I bowed and smiled
as if I thought he bantered me. He understood me,
and therefore repeated again that he meant it
seriously, and upon his word he thought that the
Queen was happy in having so good a servant. I
told him it was a great satisfaction to me to meet
with His Royal Highness’s approbation. He
clapped his hand on my shoulder, and assured me
that I had it.</p>

<p>“As we went to Richmond last Wednesday our
grooms had a battle with a carter that would not go
out of the way. The good Queen had compassion
for the rascal, and ordered me to ride after him and
give him a crown. I desired Her Majesty to recall
that order, for the fellow was a very saucy fellow,
and I saw him strike the Prince’s groom first, and if
we gave him anything for his beating ’twould be an
example for others to stop the way a-purpose to
provoke a beating. The Prince approved what I
said, for he said much the same to her in <i>Dutch</i>, and
I got immortal fame among the liverymen, who are
no small fools at this Court. I told her if she would
give the crown to anybody it should be to the
Prince’s groom, who had the carter’s long whip over
his shoulders. She laughed, but saved her crown.”</p>

<p>“The Queen has done me the honour to refer me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
for my orders to Her Royal Highness Princess
Anne, and what is agreed by her will please Her
Majesty; the height of my ambition is to please
them all. I flatter myself I have done so hitherto,
for Princess Anne has distinguished me with a
singular mark of her favour, for she has made me
a present of a hunting suit of clothes, which is blue,
trimmed with gold, and lined and faced with red.
The Prince of Wales, Princess Anne, the Duke of
Cumberland, Princess Mary and Princess Louisa
wear the same, and look charmingly pretty in them.
Thursday sen’night Windsor Forest will be blessed
with their presence again, and since the forest was
a forest it never had such a fine set of hunters, for a
world of gentlemen have had the ambition to follow
His Royal Highness’s fashion....”</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 2.5em;">“Kensington,</span><br>
“Aug. 21st, 1729.<br>
</p>

<p>“Yesterday the Queen and all the Royal Family
dined at Claremont,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and I dined with the Duke (of
Newcastle) and Sir Robert (Walpole), etc. The
Prince of Wales came to us as soon as his and our
dinner was over, and drank a bumper of sack punch
to the Queen’s health, which you may be sure I
devoutly pledged, and he was going on with
another, but Her Majesty sent us word that she was
going ‘to walk in the garden,’ so that broke up the
company. We walked till candlelight, being entertained
with very fine French horns, then returned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
to the great hall, and everybody agreed never was
anything finer lit.</p>

<p>“Her Majesty and Princess Caroline, Lady
Charlotte Roussie and Mr. Schiltz played their
quadrille. In the next room the Prince had the
fiddles and danced, and he did me the honour to
ask me if I would dance a country dance. I told
him ‘Yes,’ and if there had been a partner for me,
I should have made one in that glorious company—the
Prince with the Duchess of Newcastle, the
Duke of Newcastle with the Princess Anne, the
Duke of Grafton with Princess Amelia,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Sir
Robert Walpole with Lady Catherine Pelham—who
is with child—so they danced but two dances. The
Queen came from her cards to see that sight, and
before she said it, I thought he (Sir Robert
Walpole) moved surprisingly genteelly, and his
dancing really became him, which I would not have
believed had I not seen, and, if you please, you may
suspend your belief until you see the same. Lord
Lifford danced with Lady Fanny Manners; when
they came to an easy dance my dear Duke took her
from my lord, and I must confess it became him better
than the man I wish to be my friend, Sir Robert, which
you will easily believe. Mr. Henry Pelham<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> danced
with Lady Albemarle, Lord James Cavendish with
Lady Middleton, and Mr. Lumley with Betty Spence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>“I paid my court sometimes to the carders, and
sometimes to the dancers. The Queen told Lord
Lifford that he had not drunk enough to make him
gay, ‘and there is honest Mr. Wentworth has not
drunk enough.’ I told her I had drunk Her
Majesty’s health. ‘And my children’s, too, I hope?’
I answered ‘Yes.’ But she told me there was one
health I had forgot, which was the Duke and
Duchess of Newcastle’s, who had entertained us so
well. I told her I had been down among the coach-men
to see they had obeyed my orders to keep
themselves sober, and I had had them all by the
hand, and could witness for them that they were so,
and it would not have been decent for me to
examine them about it without I had kept myself
sober, but now that grand duty was over, I was at
leisure to obey Her Majesty’s commands....</p>

<p>“The Queen and the Prince have invited themselves
to the Duke of Grafton’s hunting seat which
lies near Richmond, Saturday. He fended off for
a great while, saying his home was not fit to receive
them, and ’twas so old he was afraid ’twould fall upon
their heads. But His Royal Highness, who is very
quick at good inventions, told him he would bring
tents and pitch them in his garden, so his grace’s
excuse did not come off; the thing must be Saturday.</p>

<p>“I have sent you enclosed a copy of my letter I
wrote to Lord Pomfret, which will explain to you
how I am made Secretary to the Queen,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
dinner, under pretence to know if I had taken Her
Majesty’s sense aright, Her Royal Highness (the
Princess Royal) being by when I received the
orders I desired leave to show it her. She
smiled and said: ‘By all means let me see it.’ She
kept it till she had dined, read it to the Queen,
her brothers and sisters, and then sent for me from
the gentlemen ushers’ table, and gave it to me,
again thanked me, and said it was very well writ,
and she saw, too, that I could dine at that table
without being drunk at free cost.”</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 5em;">“Kensington,</span><br>
“September 22nd, 1729.<br>
</p>

<p>“Yesterday, when the Queen was just got into
her chaise, there came a messenger who brought her
a packet of letters from the King, with the good
news that His Majesty was very well. He had left
him at the play this day sen’night. It also said the
guards of Hanover were not to march, for all
differences were accommodated between the King and
the King of Prussia, so that I hope now the match<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
will go forward, and that we shall soon have the
King here. The Queen opened the letter and read
it as she went along; the Princess (Anne) and the
Duke (of Cumberland) were riding on before, and
neither saw nor heard anything of this. Therefore
I scoured away from the Queen to tell them the
good news, and then I rode back and told the Queen
what I had done, and that I had pleasure to be the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
messenger of good news. She and they thanked
me and commended what I had done. I have sent
you a copy of the orders I have been given to-day,
that you may see we go in for a continual round
of pleasure.”</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 3em;">“Kensington,</span><br>
“Sept. 16th, 1729.<br>
</p>

<p>“There was one Mr. W(entworth) who had a
very agreeable present from the Queen. As he
went over with her in the ferry boat Saturday
sen’night she gave a purse to Princess Anne, and
bade her give it to Mr. W(entworth). Then she
told him she wished him good luck, and in order
that she might bring it to him, she had given him
silver and gold, a sixpence, a shilling and a half-guinea.</p>

<p>“He took the purse and gave Her Majesty a
great many thanks.</p>

<p>“‘What,’ said she, ‘will you not look into ’t!’
His answer was: ‘Whatever comes from Your
Majesty is agreeable to him’; though had he not
felt in the purse some <em>paper</em>, he could not have
taken the royal jest with so good a grace. There
was a bank bill in ’t, which raised such a contention
between him and his wife that in a manner he had
better never have had it. He was willing to give
her half, but the good wife called in worthy Madam
Percade to her assistance, and she determined to
give a third to her.</p>

<p>“All this was told the Queen the next day, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
caused a great laugh, but poor Mr. W(entworth)
upon the thought of soliciting the great Lord
L(ifford) for a sum of £15 he had forgotten to pay
him in the South Sea. When the chase was over,
the Prince clapped Mr. W(entworth) upon the back
and wished him joy of his present, and told him now
he would never be without money in his pocket.
He replied that if His Highness had not told him
so publicly of it, it might have been so, but now his
creditors would tease every farthing from him.”</p>
</div>

<p>From above it will be seen that these letters of
Mr. Wentworth were written during the period of
Queen Caroline’s first Regency, when George the
Second was abroad, and consequently the Prince of
Wales had more freedom of action. From what
little can be gathered from them the Prince seems
to have been leading a harmless and happy life with
his mother, but unfortunately there is another of
Mr. Wentworth’s letters which tells a different tale.</p>

<p>It has been said that the position imposed on
him by his father, the King, would have tried the
most dutiful and virtuous of sons, but then unfortunately
Frederick was neither, certainly not the
latter. Mr. Wentworth’s letter throws a strong
light on this part of the Prince’s life:</p>

<p>“Thursday morning, as the King and Queen
were going to their chaise through the garden, I
told them the Prince had got his watch again. Our
farrier’s man had found it at the end of the Mall
with the two seals to ’t. The Queen laughed, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
said: ‘I told you before ’twas you who stole it, and
now it is very plain you got it from the woman who
took it from the Prince and you gave it to the
farrier’s man, to say he had found it to get the
reward.’ (This was twenty guineas, which was
advertised with the promise of no questions being
asked). I took Her Majesty’s words for a very
great compliment, for it looked as if she thought
I could please a woman better than His Highness.
Really his losing his watch and its being brought
back in the manner it has been is very mysterious,
and a knotty point to be unravelled at Court, for
the Prince protests he was not out of his coach in
the Park on the Sunday night it was lost. But by
accident I think I can give some account of this
affair, though it is not my business to say a word of
it at Court, not even to the Queen, who desired me
to tell her all I knew of it, with a promise that she
would not tell the Prince (and I desire, also, the
story may never go out of Wentworth Castle again).</p>

<p>“My man, John Cooper, saw the Prince that
night let into the Park through St. James’s Mews
alone, and the next morning a Grenadier told him
the Prince was robbed last night of his watch and
twenty-two guineas, and a gold medal, by a woman
who had run away from him. The Prince bid the
Grenadier run after her, and take the watch from
her, which, with the seals were the only things he
valued; the money she was welcome to, he said,
and he ordered him when he had got the watch to let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
the woman go. But the Grenadier could not find
her, so I suppose in her haste she dropped it at the
end of the Mall, or laid it down there for fear of
being discovered by the watch and seals, if they
should be advertised.”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>The Prince of Wales having for the few years
immediately succeeding his coming to England
occupied his exalted position with a totally inadequate
income had, as might reasonably have
been expected, become exceedingly involved in debt.</p>

<p>Though possessing no separate establishment of
his own (except as will be seen later an illicit one),
yet he was placed in a position of much difficulty
and temptation.</p>

<p>He appears to have received from his father a
small and uncertain allowance, and when pressed
by his creditors was absolutely refused assistance by
the King.</p>

<p>The intervention of the Queen in favour of
Frederick at this period seems to have been quite
useless, and from that time forth grew up that sad
state of affairs which eventually compassed the
total estrangement of the Prince from his father and
mother.</p>

<p>It has been said that this treatment would have
tried the best of sons, but Frederick’s early training
and environment had not been of a nature to breed
many of the filial virtues in him. It is quite certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
that he felt his humiliating position most acutely,
and that the slights and snubs he was subjected
to by his father rankled considerably. Not the
least of these was the fact that his mother was
constituted Regent during the absences of his father
in Hanover.</p>

<p>It is not surprising, therefore, that he began to
look for at least friendship and support in another
direction and found it among the opponents of his
father’s Government.</p>

<p>Among the first of this faction to pay court to
the Prince was the polished St. John, Viscount
Bolingbroke, a Secretary of State of Queen Anne,
and one who, with the Duke of Ormond and the
Earl of Oxford, had been impeached at the accession
of George the First at the instigation of Sir Robert
Walpole for a supposed plot to place Prince James
Stuart on the throne. He had fled the country,
some say unwisely, at the time, and had remained
abroad for nine years. His pardon had been
arranged by his devoted French wife Madame de
Vilette, whom he had married whilst in exile, and
who came to England and secured the services of
that rapacious mistress of George the First,
Schulemburg—who had been created Duchess of
Kendal—at the price of £12,000.</p>

<p>Though pardoned, his attainder remained in force,
his title was still withheld, and he was precluded
from inheriting estates and excluded from the House
of Lords.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>Though deprived of any outward power, yet this
brilliant statesman simply ruled the Tory party and
moved its principals like so many puppets. It was
this talented politician who offered his services to
the Prince of Wales, and their first meeting took
place at the house of a gentleman acquainted with
both. It is said that Bolingbroke came first, and
amused himself by reading a book until the Prince’s
arrival. This took place somewhat unexpectedly,
and before Bolingbroke could replace his book, in
the hurry to kneel to the Prince it fell to the floor,
and Bolingbroke was within an ace of following it
as he slipped in making his obeisance.</p>

<p>What followed gives an insight into the amiability
and undoubted charm of the Prince’s nature
and his excellent tact. He caught Bolingbroke as
he fell, and restoring him to his feet said: “My
lord, I trust this may be an omen of my succeeding
in raising your fortunes.”</p>

<p>It is said that the Prince inherited his charm of
manner from his mother; doubtless he was like her
in this respect, and did receive from her this gift.
That he did not receive it from his father is certain,
as George the Second was uncouthness itself, and
was commonly called the “Gruff Gentleman.”</p>

<p>From the day of the meeting of the Prince and
Bolingbroke their acquaintance grew, until the
statesman became the Prince’s guiding spirit, not
always urging him, as may be imagined, under the
circumstances, on the road of duty to his parents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
and his parents’ wishes. There is no doubt that
through the Prince Bolingbroke paid back many a
wrong and slight received in the years past from
Walpole and the Whigs.</p>

<p>Of this influence of Bolingbroke—“the all-accomplished
St. John, the Muses friend,” as he was
styled by the principal poets of the time—upon the
young Prince, Coxe makes the following comment:</p>

<p>“The Prince was fascinated by his conversation
and manners. His confident assertions and popular
declarations, his affected zeal to reconcile all ranks
and conditions, the energy with which he decried
the baneful spirit of party, and his plausible theories
of a perfect Government without influence or corruption,
acting by prerogative, were calculated to
dazzle and captivate a young Prince of high spirit
and sanguine disposition, and induce him to believe
that the Minister (<i>i.e.</i>, Walpole) was forming a
systematic plan to overthrow the Constitution, and
that the cause of opposition was that of honour and
liberty.”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The first political matter in which these two were
actively engaged was the Excise Act, which was
a strong measure of Walpole’s directed against
smuggling. In espousing the side of the Opposition,
the Prince was certainly making a strong bid for
popular favour, for the increased price of tobacco
and wines, which would undoubtedly have followed
its passage through the two Houses of Parliament,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
would have been by no means acceptable to the
multitude at large.</p>

<p>The Prince’s amiability towards the people had
already endeared him to them. He was accustomed
to walk abroad accompanied by only one servant,
and he was never known to neglect the salute of
even the humblest of his father’s subjects, but
always had a smile, sometimes a kind word for
them.</p>

<p>Walpole introduced his new act into the House of
Commons in a very moderate manner on March 14th,
1733, the Prince of Wales sitting under the gallery
and listening to the debate. The arguments were
heated and prolonged, and adjournments were extended
to April 9th, when the Bill was eventually
dropped, having regard to the storm of opposition
it provoked in the country and especially in the
City of London.</p>

<p>During the speeches of the Leaders of the Opposition,
which included those of the well-known
Pulteney, Wyndham and Barnard, the following
point was made by Wyndham against Walpole:
he denounced corruption and tyranny, and recalled
the favourites of past monarchs.</p>

<p>“What was their fate?” he asked. “They had
the misfortune to outlive their master, and his son,
as soon as he came to the throne, took off their
heads.”</p>

<p>This allusion was cheered to the echo by the
Opposition, and was subsequently a grave cause of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
offence to the King and Queen, whose interests were
greatly bound up in the passing of the Act by their
favourite minister, Walpole. It is said that if their
being sent back to Hanover had depended on the
Bill they could not have shown more agitation.</p>

<p>It was therefore not surprising that the failure of
the Bill aroused the King’s indignation, especially
the support which his son, the Prince of Wales, had
given the Opposition <i lang="la">sub rosa</i> it is true, but still a
sympathy which was very evident.</p>

<p>The Honourable William Townshend, son of the
celebrated politician, Viscount Townshend, and
Groom of the Bedchamber, and Privy Purse to the
Prince of Wales, very nearly lost his appointment
and that of A.D.C. to the King through his temerity
in voting against the measure.</p>

<p>The Townshend family seem always to have been
sympathisers with the Prince, and to have been his
good friends, and this association led to incidents
which will be dealt with later.</p>

<p>Another of the Prince’s followers at this time, and
one who was given much credit for the failure of the
Excise Act, was the celebrated Bubb Doddington, a
man of great wealth and a very large landowner,
but the real credit for this rebuff to the King and
Walpole must be given to the brilliant genius of
Bolingbroke, which worked behind the Leaders of
the Opposition and moved them like so many chess-men
on a board. Bolingbroke’s hatred of Walpole
was of that intense nature, that it is related by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
latter’s brother Horace that upon Bolingbroke’s
return to England after his exile an attempt was
made to reconcile the two enemies, and Bolingbroke
so far mastered his pride as to accept an invitation
to dine with Sir Robert at Chelsea, but it is further
stated by the same authority that Bolingbroke rose
from the table at the first course and left the room;
his detestation of the great Minister could no longer
be repressed.</p>

<p>Bolingbroke, therefore, was ever working against
Walpole and the Court Party (by whom he was
intensely hated), and there can be little doubt that
he was responsible for the state of affairs between
the Prince of Wales and his father and mother
which existed at this time, and by so fanning their
smouldering distrust and jealousy that it burst into
the subsequent flame, which became a visible scandal
to the whole country.</p>

<p>The Prince, however, had many other friends
among the Opposition beside Bolingbroke and
Doddington; his artistic temperament was gratified
with the society of the witty Chesterfield (who had
recently celebrated his marriage with Schulemburg’s
daughter, the Countess of Walsingham, by taking
another mistress), Pulteney and the eloquent
Wyndham.</p>

<p>It cannot, however, be said that the Prince chose
his companions for their virtues; it was rather for
the absence of them; but possibly his young mind
received as much harm from the crafty and unscrupulous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
Doddington as all the others put
together, who, after all, were, most of them, mere
posers in their vices; but Doddington appears to
have been a kind of fat Mephistopheles, always
pouring into the Prince’s ear advice which on the
surface had the appearance of being ingenuous and
good, but had ever for its aim the aggrandisement
of the giver.</p>

<p>Such is the opinion of Doddington’s character
written by one of his connections who published
his celebrated diary some years after his death.</p>

<p>George Bubb Doddington was the nephew of a
great landowner—one of the wealthiest in England—whose
sister had been picked up by an Irish
apothecary of the name of Bubb, who practised
some say at Carlisle, others at Weymouth, possibly
at both places at different times. He appears to
have been excluded from the family circle of the
Doddington’s, but upon his death his widow seems
to have been forgiven and her son George adopted by
her rich brother, who eventually bequeathed to him
the whole of his vast estates.</p>

<p>The young George Bubb added by royal licence
to his own simple and somewhat common designation
his uncle’s name and arms, and apparently from
that time forth had but one object in life, viz., to
obtain a peerage.</p>

<p>He had commenced his career by entering Parliament
for one of the two boroughs which he owned,
and attaching himself to Walpole. Being, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
refused a peerage by that leader, he forsook him
and deserted to the Opposition.</p>

<p>In due course, on the arrival of the Prince in
England, and the manner of his reception by the
King driving him to seek friends among his father’s
opponents, Doddington was very pleased to bend
the knee to him, and offer him not only his political
support, which was considerable, but later his purse
also. This lending of money to the Prince was the
origin of the well-known unscrupulous remark,
whether truthfully related or otherwise, which has
been recorded against Frederick, and if made at all
was probably a bit of boastfulness over wine cups to
his boon companions, and it must not be forgotten
that gentlemen were not at all above boasting in
those days: “This is a strange country this
England,” the Prince is said to have remarked, “I
am told Doddington is reckoned a clever man, yet I
got £5,000 out of him this morning, and he has no
chance of ever seeing it again.” Another account,
however, states that the Prince won it of him at
play. Doddington, however, got the full value of
the money he lent the Prince of Wales in the social
distinction which the position of intimate adviser of
the Heir-apparent conferred upon him.</p>

<p>Horace Walpole states that he even allowed
himself to be wrapped in a blanket and rolled
downstairs for the Prince’s amusement, when that
young man was apparently indulging in a drunken
frolic with his intimates. But even in his blanket<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
bumping down the stairs it is very probable that he
had in his mind’s eye that peerage which he no
doubt considered certain when the Prince came to
the throne. But much water rolled under London
Bridge before George Bubb Doddington’s head was
compassed by the golden circlet of a peer, and then
only for a little time.</p>

Big Stake.</span></span></h2></div>


<p>We now pass from the Prince’s political and
financial entanglements to the softer theme of his
love, or rather <em>loves</em>, for alas! there were several of
them!</p>

<p>This subject, however, cannot be entered upon
without a reference to one of two great ladies
whose personalities overshadowed St. James’s at the
time of Frederick’s coming to England. These were
the Duchesses of Marlborough and Buckingham,
near neighbours and rivals, one living at Buckingham
House, which, as before stated, had been built
amid a grove of trees celebrated for its singing
birds—the site of the present Buckingham Palace—the
other occupying a house bearing her name on
the other side of the Park, which was pulled down to
make room for the present Marlborough House, up
till recently the residence of the Prince of Wales.</p>

<p>These two great ladies lived in fair amity, but
had their little differences like the rest of womankind,
of which the following incident is a fair
sample.</p>

<p>The Duchess of Buckingham had had the misfortune
to lose her son, who had died in Rome, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
whose body she caused to be brought to England for
sepulture in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>She sent across the Park to the widowed Duchess
of Marlborough to borrow the hearse or funeral car
on which the body of the great Duke had been
borne to the grave some years before.</p>

<p>Sarah of Marlborough, in her none too refined
manner, refused her request in the following terms:</p>

<p>“It carried my Lord Marlborough,” she replied,
“and it shall never be used for any meaner mortal.”</p>

<p>This was hardly a consoling message to send to a
sorrowing mother, but her Grace of Buckingham
rose to the occasion even in her grief:</p>

<p>“I have consulted the undertaker,” she rejoined,
“and he tells me I can have a finer for twenty
pounds.”</p>

<p>The two seem to have outrivalled one another in
pride and arrogance, and both affected to despise
the House of Hanover, though they at times
dissembled and attended the drawing-rooms “over
the way,” which they considered doing the King and
Queen an exceeding honour, and perhaps it was.</p>

<p>Both were enormously wealthy, she of Buckingham
posing as an adherent of the House of Stuart,
and no doubt using some of her wealth to support it,
although it is said that she was mean enough to
allow the pall covering the unburied coffin of James
the Second in Paris to fall into rags, though she
was in the habit of going there to weep over it.</p>

<p>“I believe I may sometime or other have complained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
of Sir Robert Walpole’s treatment of me,”
observed Sarah Duchess of Marlborough to her
friend and dependent Dr. Hare in one of her letters,
“but I never went through with it, believing that it
was not easy to him.”</p>

<p>If the Duchess had reason to complain of that
distinguished statesman in that month of August,
1726, in which she wrote, she had considerably more
reason to do so a few years later, when he wrecked
one of her pet schemes as completely as he had that
of Her Majesty the Queen of Prussia concerning
Prince Frederick, which latter endeavour had,
perhaps, set the brains of the astute Sarah working
on the very same subject.</p>

<p>The Duchess was, as it has been said, enormously
rich, powerful, and, in addition, exceedingly
ambitious, so enterprising, indeed, in this latter
respect that she made a bold bid to make her grand-daughter,
Lady Diana Spencer, Queen Consort of
England. It came about in this wise:</p>

<p>Though the Prince of Wales had established
himself as a kind of power by his alliance with
Bolingbroke and his party, yet he had gained
nothing by it financially.</p>

<p>The King remained perfectly obdurate on the
subject of increasing his allowance, and meanwhile
the sum of the Prince’s debts mounted higher and
higher.</p>

<p>The story of the Prince’s embarrassments very
soon travelled across that little space of thoroughfare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
dividing St. James’s Palace from Marlborough
House, and reached the ever open ears of the
Duchess Sarah, always ready to hear any news from
“over the way” the residence of “neighbour
George” as she was in the habit of calling him.</p>

<p>The wily old Duchess must have brooded long
before she took her next step; old diplomatiste as
she was, it was a matter that could not have been
entered upon without the deepest thought. It was
about the boldest step “Sarah Jennings” had ever
taken. When she had settled the matter in her
mind, she sent a message to the Prince of Wales
and asked him to favour her with an interview.</p>

<p>No record of this most interesting meeting has,
unfortunately, been preserved; one would have
liked to have seen a detailed account of it in
Doddington’s diary, but there is nothing of it there.</p>

<p>There is no doubt, however, what was the nature
of the interview; the wonderful old stateswoman
there and then offered the Prince her favourite
grand-daughter Lady Diana Spencer in marriage,
and with her the sum of one hundred thousand
pounds, which she no doubt calculated would come
in very handy to the Prince in his involved
condition.</p>

<p>It is necessary to make a comparison between
the status of Lady Diana and that of the lady—the
daughter of a petty German Prince—whom the
Prince eventually married to understand that the
Duchess’s offer was not by any means so outrageous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
as one would imagine. Indeed, there are those who
think that Lady Diana’s birth and position, combined
with her wit and beauty, were far superior to
those of the German Princess. Lady Diana was
the youngest daughter of Charles, Earl of Sunderland,
by Anne, daughter of the great Duke of
Marlborough and Sarah his wife, and was undoubtedly
a young lady of exceptional wit and
beauty.</p>

<p>Although there is strong evidence to prove that
the Prince had not forgotten his love for his
cousin, the Princess Wilhelmina of Prussia, yet he
accepted the Duchess of Marlborough’s offer. Some
say it was to annoy his royal father and mother—things
had reached that stage by then—others said
as they naturally would say, Lord Hervey, the
Queen’s confidant and really a bitter enemy of her
son the Prince, no doubt among the number, that
the hundred thousand pounds put into the scale
against the Prince’s debts decided the matter, but
possibly the young lady’s bright eyes—she was
evidently a consenting party—and the persuasions
and arguments of the experienced Duchess had
something to do with it, at any rate the marriage
was arranged to take place secretly in the Duchess’s
lodge in Windsor Park, and was to be celebrated by
her private chaplain. The very day was fixed.</p>

<p>If the old Duchess had acquired the vulgar habit
of rubbing her hands, there is no doubt she did so
over this matter, for it promised a repayment of old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
debts and slights which had been heaping up interest
for years.</p>

<p>No Royal Marriage Act existed or had been
thought of at that time, and Lady Diana would
have been the Prince’s lawful wife in the face of all
England beyond question if the ceremony had taken
place, but this time the Duchess Sarah had counted
without her host, she had either left out of her
calculations or ignored a very important personage
indeed, viz., Sir Robert Walpole.</p>

<p>It is not at all surprising, when we consider the
extraordinary little space which divided the residences
of the two young people, that the fact that
there was marriage in the air, and that a Royal
one to boot, should creep out. Perhaps a confidential
maid let the secret out—for there must
have been a great question of dresses going on—or
the young Prince betrayed it in a burst of confidence
over a bowl—he was very good at drinking <i lang="fr">bon
pères</i> as we know—to some boon companion, but at
any rate it reached the ears of Sir Robert Walpole,
and Sir Robert stretched out his hand—and the
arm belonging to it was a long one and could reach
all over England and even across the Channel to
foreign parts—and behold! the Royal Marriage
Scheme of the great Sarah crumbled and was no
more. “Sir Robert Walpole was able to prevent
the marriage,” history records.</p>

<p>It must have been a dangerous act to have
approached Her Grace of Marlborough during the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
few days following upon her disappointment.
History gives us no information as to what she
remarked upon the frustration of her hopes at the
time, neither is it recorded what course Lady
Diana’s grief took at the disappointment. It is
safe to assert that both ladies had a “good cry”
in private; but how the old Duchess of Buckingham
must have chuckled over it!</p>

<p>Lady Diana evidently soon dried her tears, and
apparently took the matter as lightly as the Prince
did, for very shortly after she became the Duchess
of Bedford, viz., on October 12th, 1731, but, unfortunately,
died young (on the 27th of September,
1735). But the great Duchess Sarah was not of
the nature to forget Sir Robert Walpole’s part in
this affair, and it is interesting to read her opinion
of him written to Lord Stair in her old age; this
opinion was written by the Duchess avowedly for
the use of future historians.</p>

<p>“In another book,” she writes, “are a great
many particulars which the historian may like to
look into; but I have omitted these to relate
something of Sir Robert Walpole, which shows that
he betrayed the Duke of Marlborough, even at a
time when he made the greatest professions to him.</p>

<p>“The Duke of Marlborough was made so uneasy
at the end of the Queen’s reign, by turning men of
service out of the Army to put in Mr. Hill and Mr.
Masham over the heads of people improperly, that
Mr. Walpole was employed to show the Queen how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
detrimental to her service such steps must be. He
had many opportunities of doing it. The Duke of
Marlborough having obtained of the Queen that
Cardonnel should be Secretary of War as a reward
for his services, when the war was ended, which he
hoped would be soon, and the Queen having allowed
Mr. Cardonnel to kiss her hand upon that promise,
but to let him go over with the Duke of Marlborough,
that campaign or another, if the war
happened to be not concluded. Mr. Walpole was
so low then that he executed this place for Mr.
Cardonnel, and attended the Duke of Marlborough
when he was in England with a bag of writings like
Mr. Cardonnel. He managed it so that to make
the Duke of Marlborough believe that he had done
all he could with the Queen, and at the same time
gained all the points Mrs. Masham had desired for
her husband and brother; and I had incontestable
proofs afterwards that Mr. Walpole had acted this
double part to oblige Mrs. Masham, and the Duke
of Marlborough at that time had no reason to
believe he could be so false.</p>

<p>“Sir Robert also had a great obligation to me;
for by my interest wholly he was made Treasurer of
the Navy when Sir T. Lyttleton died, though there
were solicitations from many people for that employment,
whom they thought it of more consequence to
oblige. But I prevailed, and he had then only a
small estate, and that much encumbered. And I
have letters of acknowledgment to me, in which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
says ‘he is very sensible that he was entirely
obliged to me for it.’</p>

<p>“Notwithstanding which at the commencement
of his great power with the present family, he used
me with all the folly and insolence upon every
occasion, as he has treated several since he has
acted as if he were King, which would be too
tedious to relate.</p>

<p>“I am not sure that some account of this has not
been given before. But if it has the truth is always
the same. And it is no great matter, since what I
write is only information of the historian to give
character.</p>

<p>“For being perpetually interrupted, it is impossible
to remember what I may have formally
written on these subjects.”</p>

<p>All of which above tends to show that in her old
age Duchess Sarah had grown testy, and not
forgetful of her old enemies.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.<br><span class="small"><span class="smcap">The Beautiful Vanilla.</span></span></h2></div>


<p>An early marriage with a beautiful girl such as
Lady Diana Spencer would probably have been the
best thing which could have happened to the young
Prince of Wales; it would possibly have obliterated
the scars of his old love for his cousin Wilhelmina,
which wounds certainly broke out again at a later
period, and it might have kept him from disgraceful
liaisons; at any rate it would have left him without
excuse for them. The first of these <i lang="fr">affaires du
cœur</i>, began in a flirtation and ended in a tragedy
as so many of these unfortunate attachments do.
Who knows its beginning? Perhaps a kiss in the
dark corridors of St. James’s Palace!</p>

<p>The object of it was Miss Anne Vane (the
“beautiful Vanilla”), daughter of Gilbert, 2nd Lord
Barnard, a maid-of-honour to the Queen, and sister
to the 1st Lord Darlington.</p>

<p>This young lady was possessed of much beauty,
but is not credited with cleverness as we understand
it, which was all the worse for her, as she
found herself among a set of unscrupulous courtiers,
such as Lords Harrington and Hervey, the latter of
whom was not at all above boasting of conquests<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
over the opposite sex which he had not achieved, if
such a word can be used in connection with the
meanest act on earth.</p>

<p>Miss Vane is said to have been full of levity which
was the result of her want of cleverness, perhaps,
and possessed, no doubt, the usual quantity of vanity
which is allotted to a pretty girl with plenty of
admirers, but on the whole it cannot be doubted
that she was fond of the Prince, and, as a result of
it, paid that penalty for a love which many young
ladies do who place their affections on a man who is
unable to marry them—she became a mother. The
Prince of Wales, however, did a man’s duty, and at
once acknowledged the child.</p>

<p>The whole matter appears to have been very
deplorable. The birth of the child—a boy—took
place in her apartments as maid-of-honour in the
palace of St. James’s, and the baby was baptized
in the Chapel Royal, and given the name of Fitz
Frederick Vane, evidently with the Prince’s full
concurrence. (1732). He made no denial of his
blame in the matter either in public or in private,
but took the whole responsibility upon his own
shoulders. In addition, as will be seen, he loved
children.</p>

<p>The Queen, of course, lost very little time in
turning her unfortunate maid-of-honour out of the
Palace as soon as she was fit to go, and her family
accentuated the Queen’s action by at once turning
their backs upon her. The Prince did what little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
he was able to do to atone in a way for the great
injury he had done her. He took a house for her and
her child in Grosvenor Street, and provided her with
an income out of the uncertain allowance he received
from the King. This affair, there is no doubt, laid
the foundation of those debts which grew to be
such a weight round his neck later on.</p>

<p>This state of affairs having continued for some
time, there however appeared on the scene a
remarkable person in the shape of Lady Archibald
Hamilton, who from that time forth exerted a strong—and
baneful—influence on the Prince’s life.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Lady Archibald was five-and-thirty, the mother
of ten children, and is said not to have possessed any
special good looks, but she must, however, have
been possessed of a strong will and a subtle power of
fascination—which many plain women have—for she
in a very short time subjugated the Prince of Wales
and tied him, in the public gaze, at any rate, to her
chariot wheels.</p>

<p>The very first act of this woman as is so often the
case, was to turn the power she had gained against
the poor girl, her rival, whose reputation the Prince
had ruined. She urged him to get rid of her.</p>

<p>There is no question whatever that the Prince<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
was at this time thoroughly fascinated by Lady
Archibald. Lord Hervey, who plays a wretched part
in this episode, comments on his infatuation as
follows:</p>

<p>“He,” the Prince, “saw her often at her own
house, where he seemed as welcome to the master
as the mistress; he met her often at her sister’s;
walked with her day after day for hours together
<i lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i> in a morning in St. James’s Park; and
whenever she was at the Drawing Room (which was
pretty frequent) his behaviour was so remarkable
that his nose and her ear were inseparable.”</p>

<p>Lord Hervey, it has been said, played a despicable
part in this affair, more despicable perhaps because
he had been the Prince’s friend—a very false one.</p>

<p>John, Lord Hervey, was the eldest son of the
first Earl of Bristol, had been Gentleman of the
Bedchamber to George the Second when Prince of
Wales, and was a great favourite with Caroline the
Queen.</p>

<p>It is difficult to estimate the amount of mischief
this wretched man made between the Queen and
her son, the Prince of Wales; one thing is quite
certain, and that is, that from the time a coolness
sprang up between the Prince and Lord Hervey—and
there was good reason for it as will be seen—things
began to take a much worse turn between
the former and his royal parents.</p>

<p>Hervey was the Queen’s devoted companion, and
bearer of tittle tattle. She did not scruple to even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
allow him to sit by her bed when she was ill and
amuse her with gossip, and to this arrangement the
King seems to have offered no objection, though he
was devoted to Caroline. The Prince of Wales,
however, expressed himself strongly on the subject
of Hervey’s association with his mother and sisters.</p>

<p>The Queen appears to have selected a strange
companion. The following is a description of his
appearance and character:</p>

<p>“He was considered an exquisite beau and wit,
and showed himself in after life to be possessed of
considerable ability both as writer and orator.” (He
was the author of the well-known “Memoirs of the
Reign of George the Second”). “He was an
accomplished courtier, and possessed some of the
worst vices of courtiers; he was double-faced, untrustworthy,
and ungrateful. He had a frivolous
and effeminate character; he was full of petty spite
and meannesses, and given to painting his face and
other abominations, which earned for him the nickname
of ‘Lord Fanny.’”</p>

<p>He is described by some of the poets of the time
as being possessed of great personal beauty; the
Duchess of Marlborough was of an opposite opinion:</p>

<p>“He has certainly parts and wit,” she writes,
“but is the most wretched profligate man that ever
was born, besides ridiculous; a painted face and
not a tooth in his head.”<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>He appears, however, to have been a favourite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
with the fair sex, even to marrying the beautiful
Mary Lepel, maid-of-honour to the Queen when
Princess of Wales.</p>

<br>LORD HERVEY.</p>



<p>Poor Mary!</p>

<p>Lord Hervey had been a married man over ten
years when the first rumours of the Vane scandal
began to permeate St. James’s about the end of
1731. It was then that the estrangement between
the Prince of Wales and Lord Hervey began, and
the reason for it is not far to seek.</p>

<p>Lord Hervey had been talking of Miss Vane, and
his remarks had reached the ears of Frederick.</p>

<p>Horace Walpole gives the key to the whole
matter in his “Reminiscences”; he states that the
Prince of Wales, Lord Hervey and the 1st Lord
Harrington <em>each</em> came to his brother, Sir Robert,
and confided the fact of being the father of Miss
Vane’s child!</p>

<p>As far as the Prince of Wales was concerned, it is
to be understood; he had committed a grave fault,
he had incurred a grave responsibility, he had
no wish to shirk it, although as we know he
was kept very short of money by his father. He
knew that as a man he was bound to see this
poor girl through her trouble at any cost, and he
did it.</p>

<p>But how about the cur Hervey with the painted
face, and his finicking woman’s tittle-tattle? How
about Lord Harrington, who was little better?</p>

<p>Either these two were lying, or they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
playing the most despicable parts that men could
play, viz., boasting of their prowess in ruining a
young girl, deserting her in her trouble, and shifting
the public blame on to some one else.</p>

<p>But as far as Lord Hervey is concerned, it is
more probable that he was lying; the circumstances
look very much like it. He had evidently been an
admirer of the beautiful Miss Vane before the
Prince devoted himself to her; it is more than
probable that the Prince cut him out, and that the
reason of their quarrel was simply jealousy,
accentuated by Hervey’s spiteful tongue. Certainly
hereafter the Prince had no more bitter enemy than
Lord Hervey, and, unfortunately, the latter was
placed in a position about the Queen which enabled
him to fan the embers of their quarrel, and to do the
Prince’s cause an infinity of harm. Certainly no
one can read the history of that period without
coming to this conclusion.</p>

<p>It has been seen that the Prince of Wales,
however, had formed an attachment to another
lady, much older than himself, a woman of the
world, the mother of ten children, Lady Archibald
Hamilton, and this lady had availed herself of her
ascendancy over him to urge him to break with
Miss Vane. It may be very fairly surmised that
the boastings of Hervey and Hamilton were pretty
well dinned into his ears; at any rate Lady
Archibald succeeded in persuading him, probably in
a fit of jealous anger, to send one of his lords in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
waiting, Lord Baltimore, to Miss Vane with an
insulting message.</p>

<p>This message, as it is recorded in history, does
not read like a man’s message at all; it savours far
more of the composition of a spiteful woman. In it
the Prince is represented as desiring her to go
abroad for two or three years, and to leave her son
to be educated in England. If she agreed, she was
to receive from the Prince her usual allowance of
£1,600 a year for life. The message is said to have
concluded in the following words: “If she would
not live abroad, she might starve for him in
England.”</p>

<p>A most unlikely ending to have come from the
Prince, having regard to his known habits of kind-heartedness
and courtesy.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that Miss Vane was deeply
hurt at this message, and declined to answer it by
Lord Baltimore.</p>

<p>It is here that Lord Hervey comes again upon
the scene.</p>

<p>He states that Miss Vane sent for him and telling
him of the Prince’s message asked his advice as a
friend; the result was the following letter, which, if
Miss Vane wrote it, certainly Lord Hervey composed
it, with a view, as it can easily be seen, to its future
publication; it ran as follows:</p>

<p>“Your Royal Highness need not be put in mind
who I am, nor whence you took me; that I acted
not like what I was born, others may reproach me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
but you took me from happiness and brought me to
misery, that I might reproach you. That I have
long lost your heart I have long seen, and long
mourned; to gain it, or rather to reward the gift
you made me of it, I sacrificed my time, my youth,
my character, the world, my family, and everything
that a woman can sacrifice to a man she loves;
how little I considered my interest you must know
by my never naming my interest to you, when I
made this sacrifice, and by my trusting to your
honour, when I showed so little regard, when put
in balance with my love to my own. I have
resigned everything for your sake but my life; and
had you loved me still, I would have risked even
that, too, to please you; but as it is I cannot think
in my state of health<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> of going out of England, far
from all friends and all physicians I can trust, and of
whom I stand so much in need. My child is the only
consolation I have left, I cannot leave him, nor shall
anything but death ever make me quit the country
he is in.”</p>

<p>When the Prince received this letter, strangely
enough, he did not dissolve into tears at its pathos;
he was on the contrary exceedingly angry. He said
at once that Miss Vane—or “the minx” as it is
reported—“was incapable of writing such a letter,
and that he would punish the ‘rascal’ who had
dictated it to her.”</p>

<p>He was probably well acquainted with her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
capabilities in this respect, and possibly knew her
modes of expression very well; as a rule the ladies
of the Court of that time were nothing like so
refined in their correspondence; this was evidently
the composition of a man and one indeed skilled in
letters. All this would be extremely strange if one
element which prevailed at the time were not well
known, viz., that the clever, diplomatic, Queen
Caroline was exceedingly anxious that the Prince,
her son, should break with Miss Vane, as she had a
strong wish that he should marry, and this well-known
liaison might form an obstacle, though
apparently she had no particular Princess in view.</p>

<p>There is another point, also, which must not be
lost sight of, and that is that during the three years
and more that the Prince had been in England, he
had grown year by year in popular favour, and had
entirely eclipsed the Queen’s favourite son, the
Duke of Cumberland, whom as we know the King
and Queen would gladly have seen in his brother
Frederick’s place as heir to the English throne.</p>

<p>It is impossible to say how far the crafty Hervey
with his great influence over the Queen may have
worked upon this feeling of jealousy at her eldest
son’s popularity.</p>

<p>Unnatural as it seems, unless we read it in the
light of later events, the Queen may have been
induced to take a hidden part in this affair of Miss
Vane to decrease the Prince of Wales’s growing
popularity with the people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>For what followed? Very soon the details of
this affair began to leak out among the public, a
series of scurrilous songs and pamphlets began to
make their appearance: “Vanilla, or the Amours
of the Court”; “Vanessi, or the Humours of the
Court of Modern Gallantry”; and a particularly
offensive one “Vanilla on the Straw.”</p>

<p>Knowing as we do that Lord Hervey composed
Miss Vane’s answer to the Prince’s message, that the
copy of it was soon made public, and the Prince’s
cruel message widely disseminated by Miss Vane,
who apparently was at this time entirely under Lord
Hervey’s influence, it is impossible to doubt for a
moment that Hervey was striking a very heavy
blow at the Prince’s popularity.</p>

<p>At this juncture, however, the mature judgment
of Pulteney, the leader of the Opposition, came to
the Prince’s aid, as it did at a later time also, and
under his advice Miss Vane received the provision
which the Prince had originally intended for her,
viz., a settlement of £1,600 a year for life, a gift of
the house in Grosvenor Street in which she had
resided since her dismissal from Court, and that
which she doubtless prized more than all, the custody
of her child. All this without any request to her to
leave the country.</p>

<p>And so the matter faded away, out of the public
eye, and out of the public knowledge, for Miss Vane,
with her child, went away to Bath, where very
soon after both died; the child first, the mother after.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p>Perhaps, as it is said, this poor girl had a true
affection for the Prince, and the separation broke
her heart; certainly after the death of the child she
could have very little left to live for; forsaken by
the man who had wronged her, robbed by death of
the little one on whom possibly all her hopes and
love were then centred.</p>

<p>But it was not the poor broken-hearted mother
who bore the whole of the sorrow at this little
child’s death, the Queen, and the Princess Caroline,
her daughter, both bear testimony “that they
never believed it possible that the Prince of Wales
could show such grief as he did at the death of
the boy.” Perhaps a fitting conclusion to this
chapter will be an Extract from the Register of
Westminster Abbey, 26th February, 1735-6:</p>

<p>“Fitz Frederick, natural child of the Prince of
Wales by Anne Vane, daughter of Gilbert, Lord
Barnard, buried, aged four.”</p>

<p>The Court life of the reign of George the Second
was far from being gay; it was very different from
what his life had been during the reign of his
father when he was Prince of Wales. About the
time of the Vane scandal Lord Hervey writes to his
friend Mrs. Clayton and complains of the dulness of
the routine.</p>

<p>“I will not trouble you,” he says, “with any
account of our occupations at Hampton Court. No
mill horse ever went in a more constant track, or a
more unchanging circle, so that by the assistance of
an almanac for the day of the week, and a watch for
the hour of the day, you may inform yourself fully,
without any other intelligence but your memory, of
every transaction within the verge of the Court.
Walking, chaises, levees, and audiences fill the
morning; at night the King plays commerce and
backgammon, and the Queen at quadrille, where
poor Lady Charlotte (de Roussie) runs her usual
nightly gauntlet—the Queen pulling her hood, Mr.
Schütz sputtering in her face, and the Princess
Royal rapping her knuckles, all at a time. It was
in vain she fled from persecution for her religion;
she suffers for her pride what she escaped for her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
faith, undergoes in a drawing-room what she
dreaded from the Inquisition, and will die a martyr
to a Court though not to a Church. The Duke of
Grafton takes his nightly opiate of lottery and
sleeps, as usual, between the Princesses Amelia and
Caroline; Lord Grantham strolls from one room to
another (as Dryden says) <em>like some discontented
ghost that oft appears, and is forbid to speak</em>, and
stirs himself about, as people stir a fire, not with
any design, but in hopes to make it burn brisker,
which his lordship constantly does to no purpose,
and yet tries as constantly as if he had ever once
succeeded.</p>

<p>“At last the King comes up, the pool finishes,
and everybody has their dismission; their Majesties
retire to Lady Charlotte and my Lord Lifford; the
Princesses to Bilderbec and Lorry; my Lord
Grantham to Lady Francis and Mr. Clark; some to
supper, and some to bed, and thus (to speak in the
Scripture phrase) the evening and the morning make
the day.”</p>

<p>Things had been very different in the former days
referred to. Mrs. Howard, the King’s mistress, to
whom reference has been made, was a shining light
at that time. She had been complacently made
Woman of the Bedchamber by Queen Caroline, with
a view apparently to please the King, and keep her
about the palace; but she must have been a woman
of great tact as she seems to have got on very well
with the Queen, except that at one time there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
some little difficulty about getting her to kneel
down and hold the Queen’s basin while she washed
her hands, which under the circumstances is not to
be wondered at.</p>

<p>Mrs. Howard, however, despite her immorality—which
was looked upon apparently as a fashionable
weakness—was a great favourite with the other
ladies of the Court. A companion of sweet Mary
Bellenden and her friend Mary Lepel, both maids-of-honour.</p>

<p>Here is a description of the celebrated Henrietta
Howard by Horace Walpole who knew her intimately
in her widowhood when she lived at Marble
Hill, Twickenham, and he at Strawberry Hill: he
says of her appearance that she was “ladylike.”
She was of good height, well made, extremely fair,
with the finest light brown hair, was remarkably
“genteel,” and—a great recommendation and
interesting to ladies—was always dressed with
taste and simplicity. He concludes his description:
“For her face was regular and agreeable, rather
than beautiful, and those charms she retained with
little diminution to her death, at the age of seventy-nine”
(in July, 1767). He states that she was
“grave and mild of character, a lover of truth, and
circumstantial about small things. She lived in a
decent and dignified manner after her retirement
from Court, and was considered and respected by
those around her in her old age.”</p>

<p>King George the Second has often, when Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
Howard, his mistress, was dressing the Queen, come
into the room, and snatched the handkerchief off,
and cried, “Because you have an ugly neck yourself,
you like to hide the Queen’s.” Her Majesty
(all the while calling her “My good Howard”) took
great joy in employing her in the most servile
offices about her person. The King was so communicative
to his wife, that one day Mrs. Selwyn,
another of the bedchamber women, told him he
should be the last man with whom she would have
an intrigue, because he always told the Queen.</p>

<p>Mrs. Howard was celebrated for her agreeable
supper parties, which were often attended by the
King. At Hampton Court the maids-of-honour
used to call her rooms the “Swiss Cantons,” because
they were neutral ground on which all could meet.
Henrietta Howard wisely mixed herself up with no
factions, and was a woman naturally, without spite
or jealousy, and though slightly deaf, a wonderful
hostess.</p>

<p>On account of the name given to her rooms, she
was known as the “Swiss.”</p>

<p>Many years after Mary Bellenden, when a married
woman, looked back with pleasure to the pleasant
time spent with Mrs. Howard. “I wish we were all
in the ‘Swiss Cantons’ again,” she writes.</p>

<p>And later still Molly Lepel, then Lady Hervey,
writes in the same strain to Mrs. Howard:</p>

<p>“The place your letter was dated from (Hampton
Court) recalls a thousand agreeable things to my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
remembrance, which I flatter myself I do not quite
forget. I wish that I could persuade myself that
you regret them, or that you could think the tea-table
more welcome in the morning if attended, as
formerly by the ‘Schatz’ (a pet name for herself).
I really believe frizelation (flirtation) would be a
surer means of restoring my spirits than the exercise
and hartshorn I now make use of. I do not suppose
that name still subsists; but pray let me know if
the thing itself does, or if they meet in the same
cheerful manner to sup as formerly. Are ballads
and epigrams the consequence of these meetings?
Is good sense in the morning and wit in the evening
the subject, or, rather, the foundation, of the conversation?
That is an unnecessary question; I can
answer it myself, since I know you are of the party,
but in short, do you not want poor Tom, and
Bellenden, as much as I want ‘Swiss’ in the first
place, and them?” But all that was now changed,
and the state of affairs, as depicted by Lord Hervey,
prevailed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Howard also writes herself on the subject to
Lady Hervey as far back as September, 1728 (the
year of the Prince’s coming to England).</p>

<p>“Hampton is very different from the place you
knew; and to say we wished <i>Tom Lepel</i>, <i>Schatz</i>
and <i>Bella-dine</i> at the tea-table is too interested to
be doubted. <i>Frizelation</i>, <i>flirtation</i> and <i>dangleation</i>
are now no more, and nothing less than a Lepel can
restore them to life; but to tell you my opinion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
freely, the people you now converse with” (books)
“are much more alive than any of your old
acquaintances.”</p>


<p class="center p2"><span class="figcenter"  id="img006">
<img src="images/006.jpg" class="w50"  alt="MARY LEPEL">
</span></p>
<p class="center caption">MARY LEPEL,
<br>Lady Hervey,<br>In middle life.</p>


<p>These letters from dainty hands long since of the
earth, seem to bring vividly before one’s eyes the
trio of fair women, “The Swiss,” “Bella-dine”; and
the scarcely less beautiful Mollie Lepel, “The
Schatz,” their tea-table, their “frizelation” and
“dangleation,” and other pet names for love-making,
and it seems hard to believe it was nearly two
hundred years ago!</p>

<p>Mrs. Howard appears to have separated from her
husband in 1718, and devoted herself entirely to the
service of the Queen—and the King.</p>

<p>Some may be curious to know what was her
recompense for this position of degradation. It was
not very great.</p>

<p>Queen Caroline stated that she received twelve
hundred pounds a year from the King while he was
Prince of Wales, and three thousand two hundred
pounds a year when he became King. He gave her
also twelve thousand pounds towards building her
villa at Marble Hill, near Twickenham, in addition
to several “little dabs” (the Queen’s expression)
before and after he came to the throne. She had
expected much more when the King came to the
throne, and so had her friends, but they were disappointed.
She obtained a peerage for her brother,
Sir Henry Hobart, but Horace Walpole says of her:</p>

<p>“No established mistress of a sovereign ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
enjoyed less brilliancy of the situation than Lady
Suffolk.”</p>

<p>This state of affairs appears to have prevailed
until the year 1731, when Mrs. Howard’s brother-in-law,
the Earl of Suffolk, died, and her husband
succeeded to the title. Becoming a Countess, she
could no longer hold the place of bedchamber woman
to the Queen; she resigned her post at Court.</p>

<p>Despite her position, however, with regard to
the King, Queen Caroline seems to have had some
sort of affection for her, and wished to retain her
about her person. Caroline could not have been
much troubled with jealousy of her spouse, but
possibly her intense passion for politics and all
belonging to the world of diplomacy, had long since
wiped out the other passion. Indeed, at times, she
seems to have taken a keen and appreciative interest
in the recitation of her husband’s infidelities, which
facts little George appears to have had a mania for
communicating to her.</p>

<p>The Queen, however, offered the new Countess of
Suffolk the position of Mistress of the Robes, which
post she held in conjunction with that of Mistress to
the King until the year 1734.</p>

<p>She was delighted with her change of office, and
wrote to the poet Gay in June, 1731, anent it:</p>

<p>“To prevent all future quarrels and disputes, I
shall let you know that I have kissed hands for the
place of Mistress of the Robes. Her Majesty did
me the honour to give me the choice of Lady of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
Bedchamber, or that which I find so much more
agreeable to me that I did not take one moment to
consider it. The Duchess of Dorset resigned it for
me; and everything as yet promises for more
happiness for the latter part of my life than I have
yet had the prospect of (she was then forty-five).
Seven nights quiet sleep, and seven easy days, have
almost worked a miracle in me.”</p>

<p>Lady Suffolk, however, was not content to live
the placid life which her letter indicates, she appears
to have forsaken her old wise course of holding aloof
from politics.</p>

<p>In 1733 her husband, the Earl of Suffolk died,
and she found herself a free woman with a moderate
competence. She wished to resign her office of
Mistress of the Robes, and retire from Court, but
this the Queen would not hear of, fearing, perhaps,
to get a younger woman in her place who would not
understand her ways, nor the King’s.</p>

<p>This feeling, however, the King by no means
shared; he had long since tired of the Countess and
wanted to get rid of her. He expressed himself to
the Queen in the following refined and gentlemanly
terms:—</p>

<p>“I do not know,” he reasoned, “why you will not
let me part with the deaf old woman of whom I am
weary.”</p>

<p>The Countess, however, who was by this time forty-eight,
and thoroughly weary also, it is stated, of her
degrading position, very soon gave the King the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
opportunity he wanted by meddling in politics.
She appears to have entered into some sort of a job
in obtaining a favour for Lord Chesterfield, in which
she slighted the Queen by getting the favour
granted by the King over the Queen’s head.</p>

<p>This gave George the opportunity he required to
be very rude to his former favourite, and to Lord
Chesterfield too, as a result of which Lady Suffolk
retired to Bath, and Lord Chesterfield shortly after
was dismissed from Court, when of course he became
a partisan of the Prince of Wales, as might be
expected.</p>

<p>The mode of Lord Chesterfield’s dismissal was
rather amusing. He had grievously offended
Walpole and the King by his opposition to the
Excise Scheme. Of all those who had done likewise,
Lord Chesterfield, who held the office of Lord
Steward of the Household, was the first to suffer.
Two days after the extinction of the Excise Bill, he
was going up the great staircase of St. James’s
Palace—which is <em>not</em> so very great—when an
attendant stopped him from entering the presence
chamber, and handed him a summons requesting
him to surrender his white staff. In this was the
hand of the Queen, who had never forgiven him for
his little deal with Mrs. Howard. There was also
another reason. The Queen had a little window of
observation overlooking the entrance to Mrs.
Howard’s rooms. One Twelfth Night Lord Chesterfield
had won a large sum of money at play, some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
say fifteen thousand pounds, and being afraid of
being robbed of it in the none too safe streets of
London, determined to deposit it with Mrs. Howard.
The Queen, through her little window of observation,
saw him enter the apartments of the fair
Howard, and drew her own conclusions. Thenceforward
Lord Chesterfield obtained no more favours
at Court, for the Queen controlled them.</p>

<p>Lady Suffolk went to Bath, but was not content,
however, with drinking the waters in the kingdom
of Beau Nash, she met there Bolingbroke, and is
credited with a political intrigue with him, the
person most detested by the Court. Whether this
political intrigue existed or not, King George
availed himself of the rumour of it, and upon her
return to Court ignored her. He was an adept at
ignoring people, especially his own son and heir, the
Prince of Wales. This not being deemed sufficient,
the King publicly insulted the Countess of Suffolk,
and this had the desired effect; she resigned her
post, and finally retired from the Court.</p>

<p>There is a curious memorandum in the Manuscript
Department of the British Museum of an interview
which took place between Queen Caroline and the
Countess, written apparently by the latter, from
which it seems that the Queen was even then very
loth to lose her services. But not so the King.</p>

<p>Lady Suffolk shortly afterwards married the
Honourable George Berkeley,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> fourth son of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
second Earl of Berkeley, and found a good husband,
only to lose him soon by death; but this was the
comment of the King to the Queen upon hearing
of the union, the news of which reached him in
Hanover:</p>

<p>“J’étais extrément surpris de la disposition que
vous m’avez mandé que ma vielle maitresse a fait de
son corps en mariage à ce vieux goutteaux George
Berkeley, et je m’en réjouis fort. Je ne voudrois
pas faire de tels présents à mes amis; et quand mes
ennemis me volent, plut à Dieu que ce soit toujours
de cette façon.”</p>

<p>Which, though rather witty, shows that the little
man’s pride was hurt, even when an old mistress
was made an honest woman.</p>

<p>It may be imagined that in the differences which
had arisen between the Prince of Wales and his
parents, the rest of his family had not played a
neutral part. His brother William Augustus, Duke
of Cumberland, born April 25th, 1721, was of
course but a boy at his first coming to England, but
old enough to resent such an eclipse of his own
importance by the elder brother whom he had never
before seen, and whom, perhaps, he may have been
taught to regard as a rival.</p>

<p>The fact has already been referred to, that George
the Second and his Queen are credited with the
intention of endeavouring to make their second son,
the Duke of Cumberland—the idol of his mother—heir
to the English throne, without giving any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
consideration to the fact that the throne was not
theirs to give.</p>

<p>Such a determination which could not but have
become known to the brothers was not likely to
foster much fraternal love. As regards the Prince
of Wales’s sisters, the two elder Princesses Anne and
Amelia, cannot be said to have ever been his friends.
Amelia exhibited some signs of affection at first, but
when the Prince discovered that she was betraying
his confidences to his father, he very naturally
would have no more to do with her, as a result
of which perfidy she became despised both by her
brother and the King.</p>

<p>Anne, the elder Princess, had apparently never
exhibited anything but dislike for her elder brother,
whom neither she nor her sister could have had any
distinct recollection of in their infancy when they
left Hanover, and whom they both regarded as a
stranger and interloper.</p>

<p>This state of unfortunate enmity which existed
between the Prince and his sisters took an active
form in a peculiar way. Anne, the Princess Royal,
was devoted to music, and had had the advantage
of the great Handel as her instructor, to whom she
was much attached.</p>

<p>Handel at one time became the manager of the
Opera House at the Haymarket,—one can imagine
it with its hundreds of wax candles, its powder,
patches, and orange girls—this undertaking the
Princess Royal aided by every means in her power,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
inducing the King and Queen to not only subscribe
to a box, but to frequently visit the theatre. This
must have been an infliction upon King George,
whose dislike for “bainting and boetry,” together
with the other arts is proverbial.</p>

<p>It cannot be denied that Frederick, Prince of
Wales, had the attribute of combativeness, and a
natural power of enraging others by his mode of
opposition. No sooner had his sister’s <i lang="fr">protégé</i>
established his opera at the Haymarket theatre than
he forthwith started an opposition opera at the
theatre in Lincolns Inn Fields, possibly not very far
from the present Gaiety.</p>

<p>Then commenced a state of affairs which can
only be regarded as extremely comical. All the
adherents of the Prince—and he was very
popular among the nobility as well as the people—ceased
their patronage of Handel’s theatre, and
transferred it to the Prince’s undertaking in Lincolns
Inn Fields. Excitement between the two parties
was high at the time, and the Prince’s theatre was
crowded.</p>

<p>Lord Chesterfield, who by this time was becoming
a strong partisan of Frederick’s, wittily commented
on the state of affairs one evening at the Lincolns
Inn Fields establishment. He had, he informed the
Prince, just looked in at the Haymarket theatre on
his way down, and found nobody there but the King
and Queen, “and as I thought they might be talking
business,” he concluded, airily, “I came away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>Much as this joke pleased the Prince it cannot be
expected that its repetition gave much satisfaction
to the King and Queen, and the Princess Royal, the
latter of whom spoke bitterly of the whole affair.
She commented with a sneer that “she expected in
a little while to see half the House of Lords playing
in the orchestra at the Prince’s Theatre in their
robes and coronets,” which was a remark truly
worthy of a spiteful young lady, and the anger of
the King, her father, can be understood when it is
considered that he had been dragged to witness a
performance he did not care a bit about, to be
snubbed by his nobility and made a public spectacle
of.</p>

<p>The King’s appreciation of a theatrical performance
was not of a very high order; of an opera
it was probably much worse. The following anecdote
is related of one of his visits to a theatre when the play
was Richard the Third, and Garrick sustained the
title rôle.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the talent of the great actor,
King George’s fancy was captured by the man who
played the part of Lord Mayor.</p>

<p>During the remainder of the performance the
little monarch continually worried his attendants
with the following questions: “Will not that lor-mayor
come again? I like dat lor-mayor. When
will he come again?”</p>

<p>But the resentment engendered by the slights and
ill-treatment the Prince had received from his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
family—what a family to live in the same house
with!—which resentment was shared and fostered
by his party, especially Bolingbroke, the moving
spirit of it, began to assume a definite form about
this time, till at last the Prince, no doubt inspired
by Bolingbroke, determined to address his father
personally on the subject of his wrongs. He took a
step against which Bubb Doddington in his diary
says he did his best to dissuade him.</p>

<p>One morning in the early summer of 1734, the
Prince of Wales presented himself without
previous notice at the King’s ante-chamber and
requested an immediate audience. The King,
upon whom this presumptuous request no doubt
produced an instant fit of fuming, delayed admitting
him until he had sent for Sir Robert Walpole, a
very wise proceeding as it turned out. The King
no doubt scented danger in the air.</p>

<p>On the arrival of Sir Robert, the King boiling
with rage, expressed his indignation at the Prince’s
audacity, but the Minister counselled moderation
and at last persuaded the King to receive his son
reasonably.</p>

<p>On his admittance the Prince made three requests:</p>

<p>The first to serve a campaign on the Rhine in the
Imperial army; the second related to an augmentation
of his revenue, with a broad hint that he
was in debt; and the third, a very reasonable
suggestion, that he should be settled by a suitable
marriage. He was then twenty-seven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>To the first and last of these three propositions
the King made no answer, to the second he seemed
inclined to agree. Here the interview appears to
have ended.</p>

<p>But although under the cool advice of his
Minister Walpole the King had controlled himself,
his anger broke out with redoubled fury when he
heard for the first time, and it must have been a
blow, that the Prince of Wales intended bringing
the matter of his income before Parliament. This
was particularly inopportune to the King, as it was
a well-known fact that out of his immense income
of £900,000 per annum, £100,000 was intended by
Parliament for the Prince of Wales, though the
King’s discretion in dealing with his children was
not hampered in any way. But here the Queen
stepped in; despite Lord Hervey’s weak but spiteful
satire, the Queen and her son were still on the terms
of mother and child; she used her best endeavours
to make peace between the father and son, and had
her ears not been systematically poisoned against
Frederick by Hervey and others, and had not the
Prince on the other hand been controlled by the
strong hand of Bolingbroke, she might have continued
her natural office of peacemaker between
these two.</p>

<p>On the present occasion, however, she succeeded
in at least patching up a truce; her influence over
the weaker nature of the King was at this time, as
it always had been and in fact continued to the day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
of her death, boundless. She could mould him in
those soft white hands of hers, of which she was no
doubt naturally proud, into any form she chose, and
with the Prince she took the business line of telling
him he would gain nothing by trying to force the
King’s hand through Parliament.</p>

<p>But at the same time she induced George to
advance his son a sum of money with which to
liquidate his most pressing debts, and so with this
little sacrifice on the King’s part, the matter ended,—for
the time.</p>

<p>Just about this time (1735), a very important
event indeed occurred; the King took a new
mistress!</p>

<p>He made his triennial visit to Hanover this year,
and became smitten with the charms of a young
German lady named Walmoden. This middle-aged
Don Juan—he was getting on, he was fifty-two—induced
this estimable lady to leave her husband for
the trifling consideration of a thousand ducats.</p>

<p>Madame Walmoden was a great niece of the
Countess von Platen who had been one of the
mistresses of George the First, and consequently
had a good strain of the courtesan in her blood
before she disposed of herself for the aforesaid
thousand ducats.</p>

<p>Little George at once wrote off to his wife in
England and told her all about it, just as if he had
bought a new horse; he did not scruple to describe
the person of his new purchase to his wife, minutely.
He even solicited his wife’s affection for her! A
curious race these Hanoverian Kings!</p>

<p>Further, George did not scamp the details of his
amour in his letters to his wife, which were
immensely long and always written in French, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
he apparently considered a language more fitted for
descriptions of love affairs; <em>his</em> sort of love affairs at
any rate. This is a sample of one of his letters
written concerning the inviting to England by the
Queen (which he besought her to contrive) of a
certain Princess of Modena, a daughter of a late
Regent of France, to whom he had the greatest
possible inclination to pay his addresses, particularly
because he understood she was not at all particular
from whom she received such marks of favour.
“Un plaisir,” he wrote, “que je suis sûr, ma chère
Caroline, vous serez bien aise de me procurer, quand
je vous dis combien je le souhaite!”</p>

<p>According to Lord Hervey, the Queen’s confidant,
the general opinion was that Madame Walmoden,
the King’s new mistress, would oust the Queen from
her influence, but the diplomatic Caroline rose to
the occasion. She, to retain her power, expressed
the utmost interest in the King’s new mistress, and
awaited further details with impatience. She got
them.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Not in such a manner as a profligate husband
would write in our days, even to a mistress debased
enough to read such letters, but hot and strong in
the terms of Shakespeare expressed in French.</p>

<p>So far from being offended, the Queen replied in
the same strain, equalling in every respect her
husband’s flights of fancy in the regions of Venus.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>
<p>It is this correspondence between Caroline and
the King, coupled with her very objectionable letters
to the Duchess of Orleans, which have caused many
writers to take exception to the remark of Lord
Mahon, which described this Queen’s character as
“without a blemish.” At any rate it gives us an
insight into the private life of the mother of our
Prince Frederick, and accounts perhaps for some of
her unnatural conduct towards him, for where there
is not purity of mind, how can there be purity of
motherly affection?</p>

<p>Again, a mind which could take pleasure daily in
the conversation of such a man as Lord Hervey—epigrammatic
though that conversation might be—could
not be expected to contain the natural
solicitude which a loving parent would have for her
first-born son.</p>

<p>The little King, however, was having a particularly
effulgent time in Hanover with his new
light o’ love, a time which he kept up, not exactly
religiously, until the very night before he left for
England, when standing glass in hand at a supper
party on that eventful evening he pledged himself
to Madame Walmoden and the other demireps forming
the company to return without fail on the
following 29th May.</p>

<p>Upon hearing of which promise some short time
after, Sir Robert Walpole, his sturdy Prime
Minister, remarked: “He wants to go to Hanover,
does he”? he asked, when Lord Hervey told him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
of it, “and to be there by the 29th May? Well,
he shan’t go for all that.”</p>

<p>So much did the King enjoy his revels in Hanover
that he had paintings made of them, each containing
portraits, sent them to England and had them hung
up in his wife’s dressing room! She must have
enjoyed the privilege!</p>

<p>So George returned to England and made himself
exceedingly disagreeable to his wife when he got
there, as a testy love-sick gentleman of fifty-two
might be expected to do who had recently left a
new and youngish lady-love hundreds of miles
behind. For the time being Caroline and the
English bored him; with regard to the latter he
expressed himself as follows: “No English, or
French cook could dress a dinner; no English confectioner
set out a dessert; no English player could
act; no English coachman could drive, no English
jockey ride, nor were any English horses fit to be
drove or fit to be ridden; no Englishman knew how
to come into a room, nor any English woman how
to dress herself.”<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>How this particular strain of English King must
have degenerated since James the First’s daughter
made a <i lang="fr">mésalliance</i> and married the King of
Bohemia!</p>

<p>But the little King had not wasted all his time in
Hanover, he had seen a Princess—the Princess
Augusta of Saxe-Gotha—whom he thought would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
do for a daughter-in-law, and had straightway communicated
this fact to his Queen, mixed up with
accounts of his own prowess on the field of love, in
a less innocent direction.</p>

<p>No sooner, however, had the King set foot in
England, than the Prince of Wales, urged to this
filial act of duty by Doddington, put in an appearance
at one of his father’s first Levees, from which
functions he had absented himself for a considerable
time. His father, however, once more
scented mischief in the air, and once more his
olfactory nerves had not led him astray. Frederick
at once renewed his demands, this time asking for
his full allowance of £100,000 a year, a separate
establishment, and—a wife. The Prince was
insistent.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt from an incident which
followed that in this demand for a wife, the Prince
had in his mind his old love, his cousin Wilhelmina,
still unmarried.</p>

<p>The King, his father, however, had no intention
whatever of uniting his son with that Princess; he
and the King of Prussia had been quarrelling for
years, even going the length of challenging one
another to single combat, an encounter which
would have been exceedingly grotesque but for the
redeeming point that though George the Second was
very little, yet he was undoubtedly plucky for his
size, and would have given a good account of himself
in any case. But, “unfortunately,” as some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
historians put it, no mortal combat came off, and
Europe had to put up with the two sovereigns for
some years longer. The King, as usual, talked the
matter of his son’s request over with his Queen,
especially the part about the £100,000 a year, which
her Majesty was dead against, she had all along
resisted the demand of the Prince of Wales for a
regular income, and this opposition being persevered
in on her part had undoubtedly made matters worse
between them.</p>

<p>The King and Queen’s talk resulted in the conclusion
that it would be cheaper to marry him off
and make him an allowance than to keep on paying
some of his debts, therefore having put their heads
together for the last time on the subject, they sent a
message by five of the Privy Council, proposing to
the Prince of Wales a marriage with the Princess
Augusta of Saxe-Gotha, the young lady whom the
King had seen when abroad. But this was evidently
not what the Prince expected, for this is what
happened.</p>

<p>In the first place more than a year after his
coming to England, when there had been a spark of
revival in the double marriage scheme, Frederick
had written to Hotham, the Special Envoy in Berlin,
on the subject of Wilhelmina:</p>

<p>“Please, dear Hotham, get my marriage settled,
my impatience increases daily for I am quite foolishly
in love!”<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>
<p>There is something plaintive in this message, for
whatever were his faults, and they were numerous,
yet this constancy to the girl he wished to make his
wife was honest and admirable, and had he been
given her, he might have become a different man.
But Wilhelmina was a strange girl, and in her diary,
written long after, affects to think it was only his
characteristic obstinacy which caused the Prince to
evince such affection. Perhaps it was the old tale
of the sourness of the fruit which had not come her
way.</p>

<p>When therefore the deputation of the five Privy
Councillors from the King waited upon the Prince
of Wales and proposed to him a marriage with the
Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha, they evidently
threw him into a state of consternation. It was not
Augusta he wanted, but Wilhelmina, his cousin.</p>

<p>He appears to have remonstrated with some heat<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
and then to have sent for Baron Borck, the Prussian
Minister.</p>

<p>To him he complained that his father, the King,
was forcing him to marry a lady he had never seen
and to renounce all hopes of “a Prussian Princess”—there
could not be much doubt about the identity
of this Princess.</p>

<p>He requested him to lay this statement before the
King of Prussia. He expressed his heartfelt grief
at not being allowed to take a wife from a family
which he loved more than his own, and to which,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
from infancy, all his desires had been directed.
He begged for the King of Prussia’s favour and
friendship notwithstanding, and deplored that he
should be denied his support. He complained, too,
that he should still be under the control of his
father and mother, for it was a part of King George’s
scheme that the young married couple should live
with him, presumably to save expense.</p>

<p>All this and much more the excited young Prince
appears to have said, and he seems to have deplored
the fact of the King of England disdaining the
friendship of such a great monarch as the King of
Prussia, which could only lead to the ruin of his,
Prince Frederick’s, house.</p>

<p>This impassioned appeal to his feelings affected
even that astute old diplomatist, Baron Borck, who
with Lord Townshend, had gained notoriety, by
preventing the comic duel between the King of
Prussia and King George.</p>

<p>It is more than probable that Baron Borck gave
the distressed young Prince some fatherly advice
and impressed upon him the hopelessness of thinking
any more of his cousin Wilhelmina. None knew
better than the Baron that such a marriage could
never take place. In addition the Queen informed
her son—they still had some confidence in each
other left—that the King of Prussia had definitely
refused to give him the hand of his daughter.</p>

<p>Soon after, the Prince gave in, and accepted the
marriage his father had arranged for him, apparently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
in sheer desperation, and no doubt in consequence of
a little pressure being put upon him financially, for
his father gave him no fixed allowance then as it has
been said, but simply as much or as little as he chose.</p>

<p>The young man’s pleadings to Baron Borck, however,
were not without effect; the Baron wrote off at
once to his master the King of Prussia, and reported
all the Prince of Wales’ messages, but as luck
would have it the letter fell into the hands of
Walpole, who was not at all above tampering with
the Ambassador’s post bags, and the whole of the
Prince’s love ravings were communicated to the
King, his father, whose anger passed comprehension,
especially about that part which referred to his
“disdaining the support of such a great monarch as
the King of Prussia” whom he hated, and his own
ruin speedily following.</p>

<p>All this was no doubt stored up by the Royal couple
against their troublesome son, who seemed to be in
ill-luck’s way. His parents were determined. They
had married off their daughter Anne, the Princess
Royal, in 1733 to the Prince of Orange, an amiable
but deformed gentleman who apparently married
his royal wife—he was only Serene himself—on the
traditions of another Prince William of Orange who
had preceded him. A marriage the English King
and Queen would have now. Frederick was to
marry the Princess Augusta, or go short, and it is
not at all surprising, considering all things, that he
gave in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>With regard to the above-mentioned marriage of
Frederick’s eldest sister with the Prince of Orange,
the way in which this unfortunate man was treated
could not have been a better testimony to the bad
breeding of King George and his wife. The poor
Dutchman fell ill when he landed in England, and
lay in that state for months, during which time the
whole of the Royal Family were forbidden to go
near him, lest they should make him proud by
having such an attention from a “Royal” House as
a sick visit. He was to be taught by little George
to understand that if he ever should receive any
dignity at all, it was not to be his own but a
reflection from his marriage with a Royal Princess
of England. In addition, to make things more
pleasant all round—especially for the bride—he was
given the name of “the Baboon” by the King in
the family circle, and the Queen generally graciously
referred to him as “that Animal.” All this was
calculated to establish the future happiness of the
young couple on a firm and sound basis.</p>

<p>But to return to Frederick, it is very evident that
he hesitated long before he accepted the marriage
his father proposed for him, until in fact it was
demonstrated to him that the desire of his heart
was unattainable; then he agreed in the following
words: “whoever His Majesty thought a proper
match for his son would be agreeable to him,” and
the negotiations went forward forthwith.</p>

<p>The King, after an unusual struggle, had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
intimated—undoubtedly on the initiative of the
Queen, for she suggested everything, or at any rate
sanctioned everything before it passed through her
hands—that he intended to allow the Prince
£50,000 per annum, which seems a large sum to us
considering the fact that the young couple were to
live with “his people,” but when the sum is
dissected, and the huge taxes deducted, the amount,
as will be seen later, was not by any means too
great an income for a Prince of Wales at that time.
The sum that the young princess was to receive
from her father’s grateful subjects of Saxe-Gotha
by way of income, did not transpire.</p>

<p>The Prince having given his reluctant consent to
the marriage—and there was something pitiable
about it—little time was lost. Walpole was most
anxious to get the Prince married, perhaps he was
glad to put a final stop on the double marriage
scheme which had worried him at intervals for years.
Lord Delaware was selected, principally on account
of his ugliness, to demand the hand of the Princess
of Saxe-Gotha. King George had recollections,
perhaps, of a certain handsome Count Königsmarck,
who had played havoc in his father’s family, and was
taking no risks in that respect in the present
instance. This long, lank, unpolished nobleman
shambled off to fetch the Princess Augusta, leaving
no jealous feeling in anybody’s heart, that he would
play the part of Paolo to the Princess’s Francesca.</p>

<p>There is no doubt whatever that the Princess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
Augusta was handsome; certainly she was only
seventeen, but gave promise of great beauty, she
was tall, slender, but naturally unformed and fresh
from the schoolroom.</p>

<p>Now commenced a somewhat humorous episode.
The little King George was due to meet his dear
Walmoden in Hanover on the 29th of the following
May according to promise—how he had endured the
intervening months in his state of middle-aged
infatuation it is difficult to conceive—and the staid,
leisurely formalities of the marriage contract over
which the ungainly Delaware presided on behalf of
the Prince in Saxe-Gotha, were one long drawn out
agony to the amorous little King of England, whose
deep-drawn sighs of love for his far-away German
courtesan must have been exceedingly gratifying to
his wife, the Queen, to listen to, she being perfectly
informed from his own lips how matters stood. At
last King George sent word to Lord Delaware that
if the Princess could not arrive in England by the
end of April, the marriage would either have to
be put off till the winter or take place without his
presence.</p>

<p>This had the desired effect of hurrying the
Princess, who was at the time saying good-bye to
her numerous girl friends, and of course having her
trousseau made. She forthwith set out alone, under
the care of that plain-featured nobleman who had
been sent for her.</p>

<p>Poor child! It was a cheerless beginning to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
festivities of a marriage, coming alone without
father or mother or relative of any sort to a strange
land to wed with a man she had never seen, and
who did not love her.</p>

<p>The etiquette of King George’s Court did not
admit of a Prince of Wales going to woo a Princess
of such an inferior state as Saxe-Gotha; on the
contrary, she had to come to him, but it is said that
the young Princess came joyfully, dazzled by the
prospect of becoming Queen of England.</p>

<p>She arrived at Greenwich in the royal yacht,
“William and Mary,” on Sunday, April 25th, 1736,
and was duly handed ashore by Lord Delaware, who
not being a lady’s man was no doubt glad to be rid
of his charge.</p>

<p>There was, however, nobody there to meet her.
King George did not believe in, as the Irish say,
“cocking up” these small “Serenities” with too
much attention, so she spent the night at Greenwich
Palace alone.</p>

<p>One is confused at this time with the number of
royal palaces; St. James’s, Richmond, Kew,
Hampton Court, Leicester House, Kensington,
Greenwich, and Windsor Castle, which latter seemed
to be very little used.</p>

<p>The young Princess created a very favourable impression
on the people on landing; she was exceedingly
amiable and engaging, and possessed all the
charm of youth. She showed herself to the people on
the balcony of the Palace and was very warmly received.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>The poets were ready with plenty of verses for
the young couple, of the description following:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>Which somehow reminds one of the verses of Mr.
Feeder, B.A., in “Dombey and Son.”</p>

<p>Walpole made the following amusing remark
upon it:—“I believe the Princess will have more
beauties bestowed upon her by the occasional poets
than even a painter would afford her. They will
cook up a new Pandora, and in the bottom of the
box enclose Hope—that all they have said is true.
A great many, out of excess of good breeding,
who have heard that it was rude to talk Latin
before women, proposed complimenting her in
English; which she will be much the better for.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
I doubt most of them instead of fearing their compositions
should not be understood, should fear they
should; they wish they don’t know what, to be read
by they don’t know who.”</p>

<p>The next day after the landing of the Princess
Augusta came the Prince, and the meeting must
have been an exceedingly interesting one to those
about them, especially to the populace who loved
them both for their amiability, and who cheered
themselves hoarse in consequence whenever they
caught sight of the pair.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>
<p>It is said that the Prince was very pleased with
her, as indeed he might well have been, for there is
no doubt that she was a very charming young girl,
and what man—especially one of the Prince’s
temperament—would not have been pleased under
the circumstances?</p>

<p>But after his impassioned appeal to Baron Borck,
which occurred only a few days before, it is impossible
to believe that this child from abroad—who
by the bye brought a doll with her, poor dear—could
have effaced from Frederick’s heart the passion
for his cousin Wilhelmina, which had burned there
for so many years, almost from his childhood.</p>

<p>And now the hour had come when she was to lose
him for ever; perhaps there were some tears shed in
the private chamber of Wilhelmina in far-away
Berlin, for what girl likes to lose a devoted lover?</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the young Princess waited patiently
at Greenwich Palace for something to occur; she
remained there it is said for forty-eight hours
without anyone coming near her, except the Prince,
this being a result, without doubt, of the King’s
orders.</p>

<p>His Majesty, however, came down so far from his
great altitude as to send the poor little Princess a
message from himself and his family:</p>

<p>“Their compliments, and they hoped she was
well.”</p>

<p>This was being taken to the warm bosom of a
loving family with a vengeance! And yet the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
Princess seemed to put up with it without a
murmur. Perhaps she confided all her disappointments
to her doll, and wept over them in secret
with it, or what was still more probable, they did
things differently in Germany and it was no surprise
to her. Certainly the Royal Family could not have
sent a barer message if the Prince had been going
to marry Cinderella.</p>

<p>The Prince, however, was a gentleman and
certainly did his best to make up for the coldness of
his relatives whose excuse was that they were so
bound up with etiquette that until Augusta became
Princess of Wales they did not know upon what
footing to treat her.</p>

<p>Frederick came down to Greenwich the next day
after his first visit in his state barge and dined with
his bride elect; then he did the exact thing to please
a girl. He took her out for a row in his flag-bedecked
barge on the Thames, with a band playing
sweet music before them, guns firing from the river
craft, and the people cheering them on the bank;
these seeing their bright young faces, thought how
happy the Prince of Wales must be, not knowing
of course anything about his cousin Wilhelmina
over in Berlin.</p>

<p>It is not a far-fetched idea to imagine that the
Prince thought of his lost-love on that journey on
the river—they went as far as the Tower and back
again—and wondered how she would have looked in
the same place beside him. It is just what a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
lover under such circumstances could not well help
doing.</p>


<p class="center p2"><span class="figcenter"  id="img007">
<img src="images/007.jpg" class="w50"  alt="RINCESS AUGUSTA">
</span></p>
<p class="center caption"><i>From “Caroline the Illustrious,” by permission of Messrs, Longmans,
Green &amp; Co.</i><br>PRINCESS AUGUSTA.<br>Wife of Frederick, Prince of Wales.</p>



<p>The account in the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> for
April, 1736, concludes by saying that the happy
couple returned to Greenwich together, and “supped
in public,” which meant that the young people took
their meal near an open window for the people to
see them.</p>

<p>Certainly this must have been an enjoyable day
for the young Princess, during which probably she
did not miss the presence of the King and Queen,
whose personality was pretty well known on the
Continent.</p>

<p>The next day after this excursion, one of the
Royal coaches was sent down to Greenwich to bring
the Princess up to Lambeth, where she embarked in
a royal barge and was rowed across the river to
Whitehall. Thence she was carried in one of Queen
Caroline’s sedan chairs to the garden entrance of
St. James’s Palace, by a couple of stout carriers, to
the great content no doubt of the inhabitants of
Westminster, who were assembled there to see her.</p>

<p>Her reception at the palace is said to have been
magnificent and tasteful. Certainly the meeting
itself of Frederick and Augusta was very pretty and
likely to impress the public and increase the young
people’s popularity with them.</p>

<p>On the arrival of the bride, Frederick was there
to meet her and gallantly assisted her from her
chair. Then when she attempted to kneel and kiss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
his hand, he prevented her, but instead drew her to
him and kissed her twice upon the lips before everybody,
a proceeding no doubt which gave satisfaction
to all, including the Princess.</p>

<p>The picture of confusion and happiness, it is said
the young couple ascended the broad staircase of
the Palace together hand in hand. Thus they
proceeded into the Presence Chamber crowded with
courtiers of both sexes.</p>

<p>Here, according to Lord Hervey, the Princess
“threw herself all along the floor, first at the
King’s, then at the Queen’s feet,” and by so doing
greatly pleased little George, whose kingly brow had
been disfigured by wrinkles when she arrived, for
she was a little late.</p>

<p>This act was considered by the Court as being so
exceedingly tactful that she was given the credit at
once of being a girl of “propriety and sense.”</p>

<p>But the King graciously raised her up and kissed
her on both cheeks with his royal arm round her.
The Queen embraced her too, and the remainder of
the family did their best to make up for their
neglect of her at Greenwich.</p>

<p>This must have been a trying ordeal for the young
Princess considering that her wedding was to take
place that very night at nine o’clock!</p>

<p>To avoid the question of precedence before
Augusta became Princess of Wales, the King and
Queen decided that she should dine with the
younger members of the family, and this incident<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
gave rise to a scene which can only be regarded as
exceedingly comic, and which gave the bride an idea
of what sort of a family she was marrying into.</p>

<p>Of course it must be remembered that the actors
in this absurd scene were all young, though the
Prince was the eldest and certainly twenty-nine.</p>

<p>For some reason, possibly by way of a joke, for he
was extremely fond of joking, <i>vide</i> the Bubb
Doddington incident, the Prince decreed that at this
meal, his brother and all his sisters should sit on
stools without any backs, whilst he and his bride
luxuriated in arm-chairs at the head of the table.
Upon this the Duke of Cumberland, who was fifteen,
and the Princesses, refused to go into the Dining
Chamber until the stools were all removed—there
ought to have been one for the Princess Augusta’s
doll—and chairs substituted in their place.</p>

<p>This formality being complied with, exception was
taken by these young royalties to the fact that the
Prince of Wales and the bride were being served on
bended knee and they were not. This difficulty was
got over by their being allowed to be waited on
by their own servants, who it is presumed served
them also on bended knee or in any other position
in which it pleased them to have their food handed
to them.</p>

<p>But these young sticklers remained firm on one
point, they would <em>not</em> receive coffee from the
Prince’s servants for fear they should “pass some
indignity upon them with the cups.” Altogether it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
was a scene which was well fitted for a nursery, and
no doubt heartily enjoyed by Augusta who had just
come away from one.</p>

<p>It is notable that the King, perhaps having an
idea what this dinner party of his children was
likely to be, commanded that they were to dine
“undressed,” that is in their ordinary clothes, and
not in the grand paraphernalia of the wedding. This
was probably a wise precaution.</p>

<p>The dinner and the various objections and
counter-objections concerning the etiquette to be
observed at the meal occupied nearly all the afternoon,
so that when the time came for uprising,
Augusta had barely time to withdraw to her rooms,
and commence that most important dressing of a
girl’s life, whether she be a princess or a ’prentice,
her wedding toilette.</p>

<p>How the Prince and his friends passed the
interval between dinner and the ceremony is not
stated in history, but if they spent it over their wine
certainly the Prince came up to time looking his
best when the procession was formed in the great
drawing-room of St. James’s Palace at eight o’clock;
then, the great crowd of peers and peeresses were
marshalled into order of precedence.</p>

<p>The ceremony took place in the Chapel of the
Palace and was performed by the Bishop of London
to a running accompaniment of artillery in the
neighbouring park. Here is an account of it all
from the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> for April, 1736,
which must also have been a <i>Ladies’ Magazine</i> in
the reading at any rate, from the elaborate descriptions
of the dresses worn; no doubt this accurate
journal issued a double wedding number to give
room for the information, and greatly increased its
circulation thereby.</p>

<p>The account:</p>

<p>“Her Highness was in her hair, wearing a crown
with one bar, as Princess of Wales, set all over with
diamonds; her robe, likewise, as Princess of Wales,
being of crimson velvet, turned back with several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
rows of ermine, and having her train supported by
four ladies, all of whom were in virgin habits of
silver, like the Princess, and adorned with diamonds
not less in value than from twenty to thirty
thousand pounds each. Her Highness was led by
His Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland, and
conducted by His Grace the Duke of Grafton, Lord
Chamberlain of the Household, and the Lord
Hervey, Vice-Chamberlain, and attended by the
Countess of Effingham, and the other ladies of her
household.</p>

<p>“The marriage service was read by the Lord
Bishop of London, Dean of the Chapel; and after
the same was over, a fine anthem was performed
by a great number of voices and instruments.</p>

<p>“When the procession returned his Royal
Highness led his bride; and coming into the
drawing-room, their Royal Highnesses kneeled
down and received their Majesties’ blessing.</p>

<p>“At half-an-hour after ten their Majesties
sat down to supper in <i lang="fr">ambigu</i>, the Prince and the
Duke being on the King’s right hand, and the
Princess of Wales and the four Princesses on
the Queen’s left.</p>

<p>“Their Majesties retiring to the apartments of
the Prince of Wales, the bride was conducted to her
bedchamber, the bridegroom to his dressing-room,
where the Duke undressed him, and his Majesty
did his Royal Highness the honour to put on his
shirt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>“The bride was undressed by the Princesses, and
being in bed in a rich undress, his Majesty came into
the room, the Prince following soon after in a night-gown
of silver stuff, and cap of the finest lace.</p>

<p>“The quality were admitted to see the bride and
bridegroom sitting up in bed surrounded by all the
Royal Family.”</p>

<p>That must have been an engaging sight which
the little King came upon, when due intimation
had been conveyed to his royal ears that the
bride had been undressed, and re-dressed by her
royal maids; the spectacle of a pretty Princess, in
very becoming night attire, sitting up in bed and
blushingly awaiting her bridegroom, must have been
a taking sight indeed.</p>

<p>It seems to have been the custom in those days for
a Royal bride and bridegroom to have held a formal
reception in their bedroom, while sitting up in bed,
before finally saying good-night. As a matter of
fact, this was not an English tradition at all, but a
ceremony borrowed from Versailles, where it might
have been better understood.</p>

<p>On the occasion of the previous marriage in the
family when the Princess Royal had wedded the
Prince of Orange, the latter, never a favourite with
the Queen—as has been stated already—did not
make much of a show sitting up in bed without his
peruke and gorgeous wedding-clothes, which had
certainly toned down his deformities and want of
good looks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>Commenting on the following day upon the sight
of this royal couple, the Queen cried:—</p>

<p>“Ah! mon Dieu! quand je voiois entrer ce
monstre pour coucher avec ma fille, j’ai pensé
m’évanouir. Je chancelois auparavant mais ce coup
là m’a assommée.”</p>

<p>The Princess, however, did not share this view,
and in her way really appeared to be fond of her
husband, and was dutiful to him according to her
lights.</p>

<p>It may be well to mention that the four bridesmaids
referred to in the foregoing account were:
Lady Caroline Lennox, daughter of the Duke of
Richmond; Lady Caroline Fitzroy, daughter of the
Duke of Grafton; Lady Caroline Cavendish,
daughter of the Duke of Devonshire.</p>

<p>It will be seen that all these ladies bore the name
of the Queen, the fourth, Lady Sophia Fermor,
daughter of the Earl of Pomfret, bore the name of
the King’s mother, whom he had always regarded
as Queen of England.</p>

<p>It is said that the King had grumbled at the
scarcity of new clothes at his birthday drawing-room,
certainly he could not with reason have
complained of the display at his son’s wedding.</p>

<p>This is a description of some of them from that
excellent journal the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>, and
which seems to have fulfilled, and fulfilled well, the
double functions of the <i>Queen</i> newspaper and the
<i>Court Circular</i> of our day:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>“His Majesty was dressed in a gold brocade
turned up with silk, embroidered with large flowers
in silver and colours, as was the waistcoat; the
buttons and stars were diamonds.</p>

<p>“Her Majesty was in plain yellow silk, robed and
faced with pearls, diamonds, and other jewels of
immense value.</p>

<p>“The Dukes of Grafton, Newcastle and St.
Albans, the Earl of Albemarle, Lord Hervey,
Colonel Pelham, and many other noblemen were in
gold brocades of from three to five hundred pounds
a suit. The Duke of Marlborough was in a white
velvet and gold brocade, upon which was an
exceedingly rich <i lang="fr">point d’Espagne</i>. The Earl of
Euston and many others were in clothes flowered
or sprigged with gold; the Duke of Montagu in a
gold brocaded tissue.</p>

<p>“The waistcoats were universally brocades with
large flowers.</p>

<p>“’Twas observed most of the fine clothes were
the manufactures of England, and in honour of our
own artists. The few which were French did not
come up to these in richness or goodness or fancy, as
was seen by the clothes worn by the Royal Family,
which were all of British manufacture. The cuffs
of the sleeves were universally deep and open, the
waists long, and the plaits more sticking out than
ever. The ladies were principally in brocades of
gold and silver, and wore their sleeves much lower
than hath been done for some time.”<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>
<p>One account states that the Prince in his night
attire of “silver stuff”—which must have been most
uncomfortable—passed gaily among the guests at
his bedroom reception, whilst his pretty young wife
sat bolt upright in the heavily-draped four-poster.
That he exchanged quips and retorts with the ladies
and gentlemen of the Court, in the broad style
which then was fashionable, and that a general air
of levity and frolic prevailed over all without
restraint.</p>

<p>One could have wished that those two joyous
maids-of-honour, Mary Bellenden and Mollie Lepel,
could have been there, with their bosom friend, Mrs.
Howard, to add their witty congratulations to the
crowd of compliments which floated round the fair
young girl wife sitting up in bed; if those good-humoured
jokes were perhaps a little stronger than
they ought to have been, we may rest assured that
judging from their letters which are still extant,
that beautiful merry trio, “Bella-dine,” “the
Swiss” and “the Schatz” would have been quite
equal to the occasion.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>And so the stiff brocades and the powdered heads
having made due obeisance to the four-poster and
its sacred contents, someone discreetly pulled the
curtains, and the crowd withdrew.</p>

<p>After the marriage nobody seems to have been
able to find sufficiently superlative expressions in
which to convey their appreciation of the Princess’s
conduct at the wedding. Lord Waldegrave stated
that she distinguished herself “by a most decent
and prudent behaviour, and the King, notwithstanding
his aversion to his son, behaved to her not
only with great politeness, but with the appearance
of cordiality and affection.” The aged Duchess of
Marlborough, who was by no means in love with the
Royal Family, said of her “that she always appeared
good-natured and civil to everybody.”</p>

<p>While Sir Robert Walpole paid her a greater
compliment than all when he observed how she had
conquered the gruff old King and attracted her
husband’s esteem, he declared that there were
“circumstances which spoke strongly in favour of
brains which had but seventeen years to ripen.” It
may be said here that the Princess’s future conduct
fully justified these favourable comments. She had
indeed a most difficult and painful part to play,
considering the state of affairs which existed
between the Prince of Wales, her husband, and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
father, and this at the very threshold of her married
life was greatly complicated by a most disagreeable
episode which ought never to have occurred. This
was a dispute between the Queen and Frederick as
to whether Lady Archibald Hamilton, the lady of
thirty-five with ten children, who had obtained a
strong ascendency over the Prince, should be
appointed one of the ladies-in-waiting upon the
Princess.</p>

<p>The Queen very properly argued that scandal had
linked the Prince’s name with this lady’s, and it was
invidious to appoint her to his household, but to
this, of course, the Prince retorted very improperly—but
<i lang="fr">que voulez-vous</i> with such a father?—that “Lady
Suffolk had been appointed to his mother’s household
under similar circumstances.” Lady Archibald
Hamilton, however, had her way in the end. It was
arranged by the astute Queen Caroline that only
three ladies-in-waiting on the Princess of Wales
should be appointed, leaving Lady Archibald out,
and that the fourth should be left to the Princess’s
choice. The Queen, no doubt, had a pretty shrewd
idea who the fourth lady-in-waiting would be, but
was anxious to avoid the responsibility of her
appointment; as a matter of fact, later events point
to Lady Archibald really being a creature of Queen
Caroline’s.</p>

<p>Frederick’s influence over his girl-wife very soon
became apparent and was very natural. Lady
Archibald’s influence over the Prince also soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
became a patent fact, with the result that may be
easily imagined, “the Hamilton woman,” as she was
called, filled the vacant fourth place among the
ladies-in-waiting. Not only was this piece of <i lang="fr">finesse</i>
easily accomplished by her, but she at once began to
exert a strong influence over the seventeen-year-old
Princess of Wales, which was not to be wondered at.
This influence was not exerted for the young
Princess’s benefit by any means; it would almost
seem that Lady Archibald set herself to work to
make this pretty young girl ridiculous in the eyes of
the people. Augusta was wholly ignorant of the
customs of the country, and of course very easily
led by such a person of experience as Lady
Archibald.</p>

<p>Under the advice of this lady she was persuaded
to walk abroad in Kensington Gardens, preceded by
two gentlemen ushers, a chamberlain leading her by
the hand, a page in attendance on her train, and the
rear brought up by ladies-in-waiting, among whom
it is pretty certain the instigator of this absurdity
was <em>not</em> present.</p>

<p>The Queen is said to have met this pageant in
Kensington Gardens and to have burst into peals of
laughter, which very naturally surprised the child
Princess. Queen Caroline, however, enlightened her
there and then, and compared her to a tragedy
queen.</p>

<p>To whose interest was it that this pretty young
Princess should be made ridiculous in the eyes of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
the English people, upon whom she had made a
favourable first impression?</p>

<p>Had there not also been another Princess of
Wales who had made an equally favourable impression
upon the English people and who now was
Queen? Had not this lady reigned unrivalled from
1714 to that year 1736, for her daughters were
never attractive enough to become popular favourites,
and they knew that fact very well and resented it.</p>

<p>Is it not a very plain conclusion to draw, that in
this making Augusta absurd in the people’s eyes,
Lady Archibald was simply acting under orders
from the Queen, who feared her own fading attractions—she
was very fat—were likely to suffer by
comparison with the youthful radiance of the new
Princess of Wales?</p>

<p>In addition, Lady Archibald introduced into the
Prince’s household as many of her husband’s
relatives as she possibly could, so that his apartments
were said to be peopled by Hamiltons. But
despite the evil influence of this woman, the Prince
and Princess of Wales greatly gained in popularity
after their marriage, and very uncomplimentary
comparisons were drawn by the public between the
affability and courtesy of the young Prince and his
bride, and the distinctly phlegmatic German manners
of the King. The Queen had always made herself
agreeable to the people; she was far too wise to do
anything else.</p>

<p>Within a few weeks of her marriage the Princess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
was witness of a fight in a theatre for the first time,
when the celebrated riot of the footmen in Drury
Lane took place, these brothers of the shoulder knot
and long cane objecting to be shut out of the gallery
to which they claimed to be admitted free, and
emphasizing their objections by storming the doors
of the theatre and starting a free fight within, in
which several persons were injured. In the sequel,
many of the footmen were marched off to Newgate.</p>

<p>At this time, too, the great William Pitt—“Cornet
Pitt,” and afterwards Earl of Chatham—made
his first speech in the House of Commons, in
seconding the Address of Congratulation to the
King on the marriage of his son, which address was
moved by Lyttleton. So laudatory was Pitt of the
virtues of the son that he mortally offended the
father, who never forgave him, and as an instalment
of future spite deprived him of his commissions of
Cornet.</p>

<p>But little George the King had other fish to fry;
he was due at Hanover on the 29th May, and
whether Sir Robert Walpole approved or not he
intended to go, and keep his tryst with Madame
Walmoden and the other members of her select
circle. From the King’s point of view it was high
time he went to look after his interests in this
direction, as there was a certain Captain von der
Schulemburg about in connexion with whom a rope
ladder was discovered dangling from Madame
Walmoden’s bedroom window during the King’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
visit. But George had made up his mind to go, and
go he would, and did.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Walpole, however, by way of asserting
his authority in some shape or form, got him to take
his brother Horace with him as Minister in
Attendance.</p>

<p>But before departing the King appointed the
Queen as his Regent, as usual ignoring his eldest
son; at the same time he sent a message to
Frederick intimating that wherever the Queen was,
there would be provided apartments for him and the
Princess. The Prince of Wales very naturally
resented this order, which practically constituted
him and his wife prisoners in whichever of the Royal
palaces the Queen happened to be living. The fact
of the Queen being appointed Regent was also a
subject of bitter discord between the mother and
son, creating a gap which widened day by day.</p>

<p>It has been already stated that there was at
Hanover a certain Captain von der Schulemberg,
whose name became very much coupled with that
of the King’s mistress, Madame Walmoden, and it
came about in this wise.</p>

<p>Madame Walmoden inhabited certain grand
apartments in the old Leine Schloss in the town of
Hanover—in which palace it will be remembered
that Prince Frederick was born.</p>

<p>The King lived at Herrenhausen Schloss two
miles away, and thither the Walmoden was
accustomed to drive every morning and spend the
day with the King. The King, too, would sometimes
return with her to the Leine Palace.</p>

<p>Another important fact must also be mentioned
and that is that Madame Walmoden had presented
the King with a fine boy, which she, of course,
declared to be his. The King was fifty-three,
fatuous and ready to believe anything she told him;
the birth of this child attached him more to the
Walmoden than ever, a consummation she had no
doubt calculated upon. Now it came about that one
night, when the King was away at Herrenhausen,
a muddle-headed gardener with no knowledge of
the courtly world and its pretty little ways,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
stumbled over a ladder in the small hours placed
immediately under Madame Walmoden’s window,
which looked upon the gardens of the old Leine
Schloss, those gardens through which it is said
Sophie Dorothea, the mother of George the Second,
stole disguised to meet her lover Königsmarck at
his lodgings hard by.</p>

<p>The obtuse gardener, instead of leaving the ladder
where it was and going his way, officiously thrust
his nose into other people’s business, and having
carefully examined the ladder—some say it was a
rope ladder and fixed to the Walmoden’s window-sill—proceeded
to search the gardens, believing as
subsequently stated that a robber was planning the
removal of the mistress’s jewels. As might have
been expected by one less dense he presently discovered
a man hiding in some bushes near. This
man he seized, and at the same time alarmed the
palace guard. This man being placed in the guard
room and examined proved as it is stated in one
account, “to everyone’s astonishment,” to be a
certain officer in the Austrian service named
Schulemberg; Captain von der Schulemberg, and
certainly not a robber in the ordinary sense of the
word. In addition, he was a relative of the Duchess
of Kendal—old Melusine von der Schulemberg—the
mistress of George the First. How these
Hanoverian courtesans and their belongings got
mixed up!</p>

<p>Von Schulemberg protested vigorously against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
his treatment, which he, perhaps, rightly considered
a violation of his dignity as a diplomatic envoy from
the Court of Vienna, but he did not explain how his
diplomatic mission had brought him to the foot of
the rope ladder in the Leine Schloss gardens, which
ladder led into the bedroom of Madame Walmoden.
He, however, made so great a noise in the guard
room, striking terror into the heart of the captain of
the guard by referring to the vengeance his master,
the Austrian Emperor, would exact for this insult to
his envoy, that the officer let him go, and he
departed into the night, no doubt cursing the
gardener.</p>

<p>The story, as may be imagined, was very soon in
everybody’s mouth, and Madame Walmoden was
thoroughly alarmed; she knew there were plenty to
carry the story to the King. But she took her
courage in both hands, and did what every woman
has done in similar circumstances and will no doubt
continue to do as long as women exist on this earth,
beloved by natures weaker than their own. She
ordered her coach soon after daylight, and by six
o’clock was on the road to Herrenhausen to be the
first to tell her version of the story to her elderly
royal lover.</p>

<p>At Herrenhausen she passed the royal guards
who knew her, and went straight to the King’s
bedroom. Here she cast herself on her knees by
the bed in which little George lay half awakened
rubbing his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>She besought him to protect her from insult or
allow her to retire from his Court; in a torrent of
tears she declared that she loved him, not as a
king, but as a man and for himself alone. He must
have looked far from loveable at the moment,
unshaven and in his nightcap, but these things are
never remembered when a pretty and designing
woman is making love to a man the wrong side of
fifty. George the King rubbed his eyes, and asked
for an explanation.</p>

<p>She told him amid her sobs that she was the
subject of a dastardly plot, that a certain Madame
d’Elitz had caused a ladder to be placed beneath
her window, with a view to ruining her with the
King.</p>

<p>Now Madame d’Elitz was herself a von der
Schulemburg, and was credited by scandal with
having been the mistress successively of George the
First, George the Second, and Prince Frederick
before he came over to England. These achievements,
however, are doubted by historians as far as
the Prince was concerned, but it is pretty certain
she had been the mistress of the two first Georges,
father and son. This bringing in of Madame
d’Elitz was a stroke of genius, as it opened the door
for the Walmoden to tell the King of the arrest of
Captain von Schulemberg in the Leine Schloss
gardens. It need hardly be said that her story
was accepted by King George, who ordered the
captain of the Leine Palace Guard to be placed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
arrest, and search to be made for von der Schulemberg,
that he might be again made prisoner.</p>


<p class="center p2"><span class="figcenter"  id="img009">
<img src="images/009.jpg" class="w75"  alt="THE PALACE OF HERRENHAUSEN, HANOVER.">
</span></p>
<p class="center caption">THE PALACE OF HERRENHAUSEN, HANOVER.</p>

<p>But here Horace Walpole, the English minister
in attendance, secretly interposed; he sent word
privately to Schulemberg to be off across the frontier
as quickly as he could, and he took care that no
obstacles should be put in the way of his doing so,
for the last thing, he knew very well, that his
brother, Sir Robert, wanted, was trouble with the
Austrian Emperor.</p>

<p>And so Madame Walmoden triumphed; but the
story spread, even to England, and in Hanover the
infantine features of Madame Walmoden’s fine boy
were scanned more eagerly than ever for traces of
his paternity.</p>

<p>And now, for Queen Caroline in England, a very
painful period had commenced. In the first place
the Prince of Wales and his wife had taken very
unkindly to the restrictions put upon them most
unreasonably like two children by the absent King,
and not even the influence of Lady Archibald
Hamilton could prevent them from showing it.</p>

<p>The commands concerning moving about with the
Queen from palace to palace were not complied with,
and a very ingeniously arranged succession of illnesses
of the Princess utterly defeated the King’s
intention. So keenly had the Prince felt the
humiliations put upon him by his father in appointing
the Queen as Regent instead of himself, that he
did not attend the opening of the Commission—which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
was invariably held when news arrived of
the King’s landing on the Continent—but came
designedly when the proceedings were over. In
this and in many other ways the breach between the
Prince and his mother widened, though it must be
said that at this time the Queen showed both to
him and his wife the utmost patience under very
trying circumstances. This was no doubt owing to
Walpole, who was, as Prime Minister, very naturally
her constant attendant at this time; the patience
and good sense of Walpole no doubt kept peace in
the Royal Family for a much longer period than it
would have been maintained under the counsels of
a less sagacious minister, and it is much to be
wondered at, that Sir Robert did not use his
influence to persuade the King to give the Prince of
Wales the full allowance of £100,000 a year to
which he was so clearly entitled by the vote of
Parliament.</p>

<p>But there was another matter, which was the
subject of much discussion at Court and of much
pain to the Queen, and this was the hopeless
infatuation of the King for Madame Walmoden. It
was well known to all the Court that the King had
hastened back to Hanover after an interval of only
eight months, instead of three years, and that,
moreover, he showed no signs of coming back
again. But now the Queen was not taking his
infidelity with the same calmness which she had
shown in former cases; there were signs that her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
patience was giving out, and that she was losing
heart. Her letters were abridged, from the usual
four dozen pages to seven or eight; it was this
circumstance particularly which alarmed Walpole
and others, till at last the rough, uncouth Sir
Robert spoke out to her on the subject in perhaps
the plainest language in which a subject has ever
addressed a King’s wife. He naturally feared with
the rest of the Court that her power over the King
might die out altogether, especially if she showed
any resentment to the infamous conduct of her
husband which strangely enough she had never
done before. Walpole did not spare her feelings;
he reminded her of her age and the beauty of her
rival, the Walmoden; he did not scruple to say that
the Queen’s attractions had faded, and that she
could never expect to regain the ascendency over
the King which she had for so long enjoyed. He
urged her to resume her long letters to her husband,
and to write them in a spirit of humility and submission.
Finally, he made the most extraordinary
request that has ever been made to a wronged and
angry wife; he advised her to write and invite the
King to bring back his new mistress to England
with him.</p>

<p>No wonder the tears sprang to the Queen’s eyes;
but it is said she at once suppressed them, and
attracted by the bait of fresh power over her
husband temptingly held out by the wily Sir Robert—who
wished to get this new mistress of the King<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
into his own power, and under his own eye—the
Queen consented to follow his advice.</p>

<p>Then came a time of doubt and apprehension;
it was questioned whether the woman in the Queen’s
nature would not get the ascendency, and that she
would revolt from this vile thing. But she did
nothing of the sort; in a few days Walpole had the
satisfaction of knowing that the very letter he
desired had been sent off to the King. Still
Walpole had some distrust of the Queen; she was
too calm and too compliant to satisfy him, and he
confided to a friend that he could stand the Queen’s
anger and reproof, but he was afraid of her when
she “daubed” (<i>i.e.</i>, flattered).</p>

<p>But the Queen spoke quite calmly of her rival,
and actually allotted her rooms in the palace.
Moreover, to Walpole’s amazement, she proposed
to take her into her own service, no doubt with a
view to keeping an eye upon her, as she had done in
the case of the King’s former mistress, Lady Suffolk.</p>

<p>But this arrangement Walpole opposed, and she
in reply quoted the case of Lady Suffolk; to this
Sir Robert rejoined that “there was a difference
between the King making a mistress of the Queen’s
servant, and making a Queen’s servant of his
mistress!”</p>

<p>“The people,” he continued, “might reasonably
look upon the first as a very natural condition of
things, whilst popular feelings of morality might be
outraged by the second.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<p>The King’s reply to his wife’s letter was just
what the old minister had calculated upon; it was
full of admiration at his wife’s amiability, and he
forthwith proceeded to give her by way of reward
glowing descriptions of her rival’s attractions, both
of the mind and body. Principally the latter,
and he finished up with a fervent tribute to his
wife’s virtue, which he longed to imitate, but he
excused himself pitifully: “You know my passions,
my dear Caroline”—he prided himself on his
passions—“you know my weaknesses,” and he
finished up with a semi-blasphemous appeal to God
that Caroline might cure him of them. But as the
Queen had failed to do this as a beautiful young
woman, it was rather hopeless to look for a cure
that way now that she was fat, getting wrinkled,
and nearly fifty-four.</p>

<p>The King about this time also took an opportunity
of consulting the Queen on the subject of
that very convincing rope ladder which had been
discovered dangling from Madame Walmoden’s
bedroom window with Captain von der Schulemberg
hiding in very close proximity to its earthly end, by
which it is supposed that he intended to mount to a
very carnal Elysium. Little George was anxious to
hear what his wife thought of the matter, which
looks very much as if he had not entirely swallowed
that very ingenious story sobbed out by the
implicated fair one that early morning at Herrenhausen.
But much as he valued her opinion, still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
he advised her to take further advice on the point,
as if it were a subject of State importance. He
asked her to consult Walpole—who must have been
intensely amused, and probably had a good laugh
over it with the Queen. Walpole “<i lang="fr">le gros homme</i>”
as he called him, “who,” continued the simple
little King, “has more experience in these sort of
matters, my dear Caroline, than yourself, and who,
in the present affair, must necessarily be less
prejudiced than I am.” How they must have
<em>roared</em>!</p>

<p>But while the King was wasting his time in
Hanover, the Prince and Princess of Wales were
growing in popular favour at home, and it must be
said that the young couple did their best to further
this feeling of the people.</p>

<p>There was slowly and surely growing among the
public a feeling of disgust at the King, and it was
said by some that it would be better if he remained
away in Hanover with his German mistress
altogether. Another matter which brought George
the Second into disrepute was that it was said he
kept several important commissions in the Army
vacant, and pocketed the pay attached to them.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
This was the kind of thing very popular with his
late father’s mistresses, Schulemburg and others.</p>

<p>The Queen was greatly commiserated, and indeed
was to be pitied under the circumstances, although
she had to a great extent brought the trouble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
on herself by her abominable pandering to her
husband’s vices.</p>

<p>Insulting pasquinades now began to make their
appearance directed against the King. A lame,
blind and aged horse with a saddle and a pillion
behind it was sent to wander loose through the
streets—in which, of course, there were no police—with
a placard tied to its head asking that no one
should stop him as he was “the King’s Hanoverian
equipage going to fetch His Majesty and his w——
to England.”</p>

<p>But the most insulting of these public notices
was that affixed to St. James’s Palace itself and
which read as follows:</p>

<p>“Lost or strayed out of this house a man who
has left a wife and six children on the Parish.
Whoever will give any tidings of him to the
Churchwardens of St. James’s Parish so as he
may be got again, shall receive four shillings and
sixpence reward. N.B.—This reward will not be
increased, nobody judging him to deserve a crown.”</p>

<p>Strangely enough the little King was not
exasperated with these public satires on his
immorality and neglect of his wife. He liked to
be considered a Don Juan and a bit of a rake; the
only jokes which angered him were those in which
he was referred to as a senile libertine, past the age
for gallantry.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the friction between Frederick and
his mother increased, and was much added to by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
the conduct of the Princess in arriving late for
church on several Sundays, and causing Her
Majesty to cease her devotions, rise from her knees,
and permit the Princess to squeeze by her—the
Queen was very stout and the pew small—to her
seat.</p>

<p>This conduct was attributed by those about the
Queen to the Prince of Wales, who had designed a
studied insult by it, to make his mother look
ridiculous, but it is much more likely to have been
the thoughtless act of a young girl. However, after
two or three Sundays of it, the Queen made
arrangements for the Princess to come in at another
door. Lord Hervey appears to have been very
active in fomenting the disagreement between
Queen Caroline and the Prince and Princess of
Wales at this time, particularly during a squabble
which occurred concerning the removal of Frederick
and his wife from Kensington to St. James’s, when
they found the dulness of the former place intolerable.
The Queen was greatly upset by this, as it is pretty
certain that she had received definite orders from
her husband not to let the Prince of Wales live in
any other palace but that which she inhabited, for
the very good reason that he did not want him to
set up a separate Court, which would have been
in opposition to his own, and in addition, an
exceedingly popular one.</p>

<p>The Prince’s letter in reply—written in French—seems
to have been a very dutiful one, but was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
thought to have been written for him by Lord Chesterfield.
Lord Hervey unintentionally paid a great
compliment to Lord Chesterfield’s accomplishments
by saying that the letter might have been written
by “Young Pitt,” but was certainly not sufficiently
elegant for Lord Chesterfield. It was about this
time that the Prince began to sink deeper and
deeper into debt, a consequence no doubt of his
marriage, and very foolishly began to raise money
at enormous interest to be repaid on the death of
his father.</p>

<p>This, of course, very soon reached the ears of the
Queen, and Lord Hervey appears to have made
himself particularly active about the matter.
During a discussion which ensued between them
the Queen seems to have remarked that she
considered the Prince of Wales far too unambitious
to wish for the death of his father, to which Hervey
replied that if that were so, certainly the feeling did
not extend to the Prince’s creditors, who would be
immensely benefited by the King’s death. He went
so far as to point out that the Sovereign’s life was
in jeopardy as a result of the <i lang="fr">post obits</i> of the Prince
of Wales, and suggested that a Bill should be
brought into Parliament making it a capital offence
for any man to lend money for a premium at the
King’s death, and so worked upon the Queen’s
feelings that she replied:</p>

<p>“To be sure it ought to be so, and pray talk a
little with Sir Robert Walpole about it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

<p>But Walpole very wisely ignored the suggestion,
being, no doubt well aware of the source from which
it came; he was far too sagacious to bring the
private disputes of the Royal Family before the
public.</p>

<p>The Queen then approached the Princess of
Wales with a view to engaging her influence to
prevent the Prince borrowing money, but the
Princess showed her wisdom by declining to take
sides against her husband, for which dutiful decision
she gained but small thanks from her mother-in-law.
But now the King at last decided to tear
himself away from Hanover, and at the same time
to accept the Queen’s very kindly offer that he
should bring his lady love, Madame de Walmoden,
to England with him. What an offer from a wife!
What a married state for any unfortunate woman to
have lived in! King George was in deadly earnest
about bringing over his paramour with him, and
ordered the apartments lately occupied by Lady
Suffolk to be prepared for her, and this it appears,
under the Queen’s directions, was done.</p>

<p>This letter of the King was shown to Walpole by
Caroline:</p>

<p>“Well now, Sir Robert,” she said, “I hope you
are satisfied. You see this minion is coming to
England.”</p>

<p>Walpole, however, had evidently received private
information from his brother who was Minister in
Attendance on the King in Hanover; he shook<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
his head in answer to the Queen’s remark, and said
he did not believe that the Walmoden would come,
and that, in his opinion, she was afraid of the
Queen.</p>

<p>He was quite right; at the last moment, Madame
de Walmoden changed her mind—if she really had
had any intention of coming—and decided to remain
in Hanover; she had no fancy for crossing swords
with Caroline. So King George set off in a huff by
himself for Helvetsluis <i lang="fr">en route</i> for home.</p>

<p>The Prince of Wales, meanwhile, had been steadily
gaining in popular favour, while it was known that the
King had been squandering large sums of money—English
money for the most part—in Hanover on
German women, a fact which greatly disgusted his
English subjects. Frederick very judiciously gave
£500 to the Lord Mayor for the purpose of releasing
poor freemen of the city from debtors’ prisons.
This was particularly exasperating to the Queen,
Hervey and other members of the Court party, who
knew that this £500 was probably borrowed at
usurious interest on a <i lang="fr">post obit</i> of the King. Frederick
and his wife, however, went placidly on their way,
leaving their suite at Kensington, where the Queen
was, and themselves coming into town and holding a
little Court of their own, which was the very thing
the little King had tried to prevent.</p>

<p>It may have been reports of these matters, and
the growing discontent at his absence which caused
the King to hasten to Helvetsluis—he left Hanover<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
on December 7th after a ball and farewell supper at
Herrenhausen, without even stopping at the Hague
to see his daughter Anne, Princess of Orange, who
was at that time at death’s door after the death of a
still-born daughter, and had sent him an urgent
message to come to her. But George was not a
feeling parent, and, above all, disliked anything to
do with children.</p>

<p>And now occurred an event which caused in
England both consternation and satisfaction; consternation
to the Queen and the Court party—Hervey
and his like particularly felt it—and satisfaction
to the bulk of the English people, who had
had quite sufficient of George the Second and his
doings and who ardently desired the accession to the
throne of their favourite the Prince of Wales.</p>

<p>The wind being fair, and the King being reported
arrived at Helvetsluis and about to embark, a terrific
hurricane arose in the channel in which it was
considered impossible that the Royal Yacht could
have lived. Wagers were freely laid in London
against the King ever setting foot in his kingdom
of England again. The possibilities of the future
began to be very freely discussed, even in the Royal
Family, and the Queen’s confidant showed decided
signs of trimming. The Queen was greatly alarmed,
and even imagined that she saw in Frederick signs of
satisfaction; she now roundly abused her son to Hervey,
saying: “Mon Dieu! Popularity always makes
me feel sick, but Fritz’s popularity makes me vomit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>The Prince, however, appears to have conducted
himself very moderately during this period, and to
have had every consideration for his mother. Not
one infilial remark is recorded of him at this crisis,
and if he had made one it is pretty certain to have
been noted by his enemy Hervey in his letters,
which did not omit much, true or false, which was
to the Prince’s discredit.</p>

<p>The Princesses, his sisters, who had been his
enemies also, were appalled at the prospect of his
becoming King, and one of them declared that it
was her intention to depart “<i lang="fr">au grand galop</i>.”
The state of uncertainty as to the King’s safety
continued for over a week, during which the fears
of the Queen and her party were increased by the
news that the sound of guns booming far away in
the channel as if fired by ships in distress had been
heard from Harwich.</p>

<p>Things began to look very black indeed, and it
was thought necessary for the Prince to prepare his
mother for the worst, and Lord Hervey also hinted
that he thought the King’s case was hopeless.</p>

<p>But the citizens of London who idolized the
Prince and Princess of Wales were secretly
delighted, and would not have been averse to
hearing that the Walmoden was on Board the
Royal Yacht with the King. But at the gloomiest
moment, a courier who had risked his life in the
awful tempest with the crew of the vessel in which
he sailed especially to carry a letter to the Queen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
was “miraculously,” as it was excitedly stated,
flung ashore at Yarmouth, and came post haste to
London with the news that the King had not embarked
at all, but was waiting for fine weather at
Helvetsluis. This courageous messenger and the
still more courageous crew of the vessel had been
three days at sea with the wind in their teeth and
their opportune landing was spoken of by mariners
in the terms mentioned above.</p>

<p>The Queen showed great joy at hearing everybody
cry “The King is safe! the King is safe!”
when the courier in his muddy boots arrived, but it
was a terrible shock to the partisans of the Prince,
and his friends in the City could with difficulty
muster up the necessary congratulations.</p>

<p>The Queen who had shown an outward calm
during the crisis now expressed herself joyously in
characteristic terms:—</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">J’ai toujours dit que le Roi n’était pas
embarque</i>;” she exclaimed. “<i lang="fr">On a beau voulu
m’effraier cet après-diner avec leur letters, et leur
sots, gens de Harwich; j’ai continue à lire mon
Rollin, et me moquois de tout cela.</i>”</p>

<p>This was a hit at Frederick who had brought her
the news from Harwich in a letter. Rollin was one
of her favourite books. But strange to say the
matter by no means ended here. Fine weather
came with an easterly wind which was just what
the King wanted, and matters looked perfectly
settled for his return, but it was not so. Scarcely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
had this fine spell lasted long enough to allow the
King time to embark when the wind veered to the
north-west and blew again an awful hurricane,
worse if possible than the former one which had
caused such grave anxiety at the Court. This was
on the 20th of December, 1736, and no doubt
whatever was now held that the King had embarked
as indeed he had. From the 20th to the
24th there was no news of him at all, but on the
latter date tidings arrived which were far from reassuring.
A shattered mastless sloop was thrown
up on the coast, having on board a party of clerks
from the Secretary’s office of the King, and these
stated that they had sailed with His Majesty from
Helvetsluis on the previous Monday, and that they
had remained with the rest of the fleet until the
storm arose when the Admiral, Sir Charles Wager,
had made the signal for each ship to look after
itself. When the passengers of the sloop last saw
the Royal Yacht, she was “tacking about” with a
view apparently to make an endeavour to return to
Helvetsluis. So grave was this news considered,
that Sir Robert Walpole prevented the Queen from
interviewing these shipwrecked clerks. Once more
were the hopes and exultations of the Court Party
ruthlessly shattered; once more did the partisans
of the Prince with his stout friends in the city rub
their hands in dark corners. This time the Queen
was thoroughly alarmed, and showed it in her
countenance. The next day, Christmas Day, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
perhaps the gloomiest in men’s knowledge at that
time. On this day, probably in the early morning,
four ships of the King’s convoy were thrown up in
a mastless condition on the coast, and the only
account of the King which they could give, was
that about six o’clock on the Monday night, the
20th December, a gun was fired by Sir Charles
Wager’s order as a signal for the fleet to separate;
a kind of <i lang="fr">sauve qui peut</i>. That the wind continued
in its full violence for forty-eight hours after this.
One of the letters containing this intelligence was
brought by Lord Augustus Fitzroy, second son of
the Duke of Grafton, who, though only twenty
years of age, was Captain of a man-of-war, “The
Eltham,” which had succeeded with great difficulty
in getting into Margate that Christmas morning.</p>

<p>This further news was kept from the Queen
altogether, and that evening a sad party sat down
in the Palace of St. James’s to pretend to play
cards, while every ear was strained to catch the
least sound which might be the precursor of the
news of the King’s death. In basset and cribbage was
that Christmas night passed by the Queen, while
Sir Robert Walpole, the Dukes of Grafton, Newcastle,
Montagu, Devonshire and Richmond, with
Lord Hervey, talked of everything they could think
of, but the King’s danger, or walked moodily up
and down in the shadows.</p>

<p>But the next morning, the 26th, Sir Robert
Walpole came to the Queen at nine o’clock and told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
her all. Then her fortitude gave way and she
wept, but not for long. She dried her tears and
expressed her intention of going to church—it was a
Sunday. This resolve Sir Robert considered most
injudicious as it would make the Queen an object of
curiosity in public, which in her disturbed state was
not desirable. It did not seem to strike this old
heathen that she went there to pray, and even if it
had, he would have been quite wrong, as the
Queen’s own expressed reason was that she would
not give up hope, and believe her husband drowned
until it became a certainty. That her stopping
away from Church would have been construed into
an admission of the King’s death. However, all her
doubts were ended during the service, as once more
an express arrived from the King to tell her he was
safe and sound, but had been terribly sea-sick.
That after setting sail from Helvetsluis on the
previous Monday morning at eight o’clock, he had
with difficulty regained that port at three on the
following afternoon.</p>

<p>The King blamed Sir Charles Wager for the
whole business, and said the Admiral had hurried
him on board against his will, whereas, in truth it
was the King who was impatient, and who had said
that unless the Admiral would sail, he would go
over in a packet boat rather than endure Helvetsluis
any longer.</p>

<p>“Be the weather what it may,” concluded the
irascible little King, “I am not afraid.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span></p>

<p>“<em>I am</em>,” laconically responded the Admiral.</p>

<p>George persisted.</p>

<p>“I want to see a storm,” continued the King,
“and would rather be twelve hours in one than
shut up twenty-four in Helvetsluis.”</p>

<p>“Twelve hours in a storm,” replied the rough and
ready Admiral, “four hours would do your business
for you.”</p>

<p>The Admiral refused to sail until the wind was
fair, clinching the argument by remarking that
though the King might make him go, “I,” concluded
Sir Charles with satisfaction, “can make you
come back again.”</p>

<p>And he did bring him back again, for which the
King ought to have been eternally grateful to him,
for it was only the splendid seamanship of the
Admiral which saved him.</p>

<p>“Sir,” remarked Sir Charles, when they did get
back, “you wished to see a storm, how did your
Majesty like it?”</p>

<p>“So well,” answered the King, no doubt with a
most rueful countenance, for he had been fearfully
sick, “that I never wish to see another!”</p>

<p>The Admiral remarked in a letter to a friend at
the time: “His Majesty was at present as <em>tame</em> as
any about him.”</p>

<p>“An epithet,” comments Lord Hervey who had
read the letter, “that his Majesty, had he known it,
would, I fancy, have liked, next to the storm, the
least of anything that happened to him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>

<p>But there were many of these letters came to the
Court by the same ship which brought the King’s,
and the above passage of words between George
and the Admiral was well known in the King’s
suite at Helvetsluis, therefore when the Queen
walked about with the King’s letter in her hand
praising her husband’s patience, and condemning
Admiral Wager as the cause of all their apprehension,
it was somewhat difficult for the couriers
to keep their countenances when they realized the
King’s wilful mendacity to his wife.</p>

<p>All the hopes of the Prince’s party were now
crushed, but it is not recorded by Lord Hervey that
Frederick gave vent to any other remark but that
of thankfulness for his father’s return.</p>

<p>His followers, and especially those in the city,
while expressing their thankfulness, qualified it; the
common expression in referring to the King’s escape
was—“It’s the mercy of God, but a thousand
pities!”</p>

<p>It is to be feared that had they heard that the
Royal Yacht with the King and Madame Walmoden
on board, had sunk in mid-Channel, the
expression of their thanks might have been the
same without the concluding sentence.</p>

<p>The catch query at the time of this voyage was:</p>

<p>“How’s the wind for the King?”</p>

<p>And the popular answer was:—“Like the
nation, against him.”</p>

<p>The danger over, the Queen confided her feelings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
to her almost inseparable companion the Vice-Chamberlain,
Lord Hervey; after telling him of her
affection for him—it was a motherly affection, she
was fifty-three,—and the pleasure his society gave
her she added:</p>

<p>“You and yours should have gone with me to
Somerset House<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and though I have neither so good
an apartment there for you as you have here, nor
an employment worth your taking, I should have
lodged you as well as I could, and given you at
least as much as you have now from the King.”</p>

<p>The Queen, however, wrote a very dutiful and
tender letter to the King, full of art and flattery,
but it seems to have touched George’s heart deeply;
perhaps in those twelve hours of tossing in the
storms of the Channel, the little man had thought
seriously of the foolishness of leaving so good a wife,
that in the search after happiness, he was leaving
the substance in Caroline—and she was certainly
substantial—for the elusive shadow in the Walmoden;
anyhow he wrote his Queen a most remarkable
letter of thirty pages, more the effusion of an
eager lover than an old man for his wife.</p>

<p>“In spite of all the danger I have incurred in
this tempest, my dear Caroline,” he wrote, “and
notwithstanding all I have suffered, having been ill
to an excess which I thought the human body could
not bear, I assure you that I would expose myself
to it again and again to have the pleasure of hearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
the testimonies of your affection, with which my
position inspired you. This affection which you
testify for me, this friendship, this fidelity, the inexhaustible
goodness which you show for me, and
the indulgence which you have for all my
weaknesses, are so many obligations, which I can
never sufficiently recompense, can never sufficiently
merit, but which I also can never forget.”<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Certainly the storm had shaken the little man
very much and left him in a condition which would
have proved weak in the crisis which arose after his
return, had he not been supported on the one hand
by Walpole and on the other by his ever scheming
Queen.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.<br><span class="small"><span class="smcap">Parliament and the Prince’s Income.</span></span></h2></div>


<p>It has been stated that the Prince of Wales’s
popularity had been steadily growing ever since his
marriage. It was much increased about this time,
just before the King’s return, by his determined
action at a fire which occurred near the Temple, the
latter cluster of old buildings being said to have
been saved by his timely intervention, which limited
the loss to five or six houses.</p>

<p>He appears to have worked among the crowd, and
to have excited its admiration to a remarkable
degree. Some unwise persons raised a cry of
“Crown him! Crown him!!” and this being duly
reported to his mother, the Queen, caused her the
gravest anxiety, and the most unreasonable anger.</p>

<p>Hervey, as usual, poured oil, not upon the
troubled waters, but upon the fire of her wrath; he
suggested that owing to the King being so much
hated and the Prince so popular, the latter believed
that his favour with the people helped to keep his
father on the throne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>To this the Queen replied bitterly that owing to
the reports of the Prince’s popularity—brought to
her principally by Lord Hervey, who was her news-carrier-in-chief—that
popularity, instead of keeping
the King upon the throne, was likely to depose
him. But a far greater cause of dissension between
the Prince of Wales and his parents was now
looming very near. It cannot be doubted that
when Lord Bolingbroke, to use his own words, “left
the stage,” he gave to the Prince detailed instructions
for a move to be made in Parliament
for an increase of his income; that increase which
he, together with the bulk of the nation, considered
he was fully entitled to under the settlement of the
Civil List on his father ascending the throne of
England. The subtle talent of the great diplomatist
had mapped all this out long before he
left these shores, possibly as a Parthian shaft at
his enemies whom he left behind triumphant. Be
this as it may, a glance at the Prince’s position
will, however, fully justify the course he took.</p>

<p>Before his marriage, it appears that he received
from his father £24,000 a year, not in any fixed or
settled income, but as the King chose to give it to
him. It must be remembered that the cost of living
for royal personages was then much more than it is
at present, the expenses for dress and the <i>personnel</i>
of the Household were far in excess of anything we
know of in our day. In those times as much as five
hundred pounds were given for one court suit, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
the ladies’ dresses were in proportion as regards cost.</p>

<p>On the Prince’s marriage, no jointure was settled
on his wife, who brought him a paltry dowry of five
thousand pounds, but the King increased his allowance
to £50,000 a year.</p>

<p>This on the face of it appeared a wonderful
addition, but it must be remembered that the Prince
was very much in debt, and that the expenses of
the marriage itself were enormous; they could not
possibly have been otherwise in the case of a Prince
of Wales.</p>

<p>As regards the increase in his household, the
expenses were at once doubled, as the Princess had
practically a new household of her own, with ladies-in-waiting,
gentlemen-in-waiting, women of the
bedchamber, gentlemen ushers, and a host of others
required by the Court etiquette of the time. What
would have been a large income for a nobleman was
totally inadequate for the Prince of Wales, and as a
result he commenced at once to fall deeper and
deeper into debt. It is not surprising with these
facts facing him, and with the knowledge that his
father—who most of this time was engaged in
squandering enormous sums of good English gold on
German women—received from George the First,
the full sum of £100,000 per annum allotted by
Parliament as the income of the Prince of Wales.
These thoughts, together with the prospect of
greatly increased expenses in the future must have
been very galling—for the probability of a child<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
being born to them must have been known to the
Prince and Princess at this time, though not
disclosed until later. It is not to be wondered at
then that the Prince thought over Bolingbroke’s
counsels, and eventually decided to take a strong
step to obtain that increase in his income to which
he was evidently fully entitled by Act of Parliament,
and which he would have received in the ordinary
way but for the fact of the hatred and meanness of
his parents towards him. For the hatred at least a
good reason will be shown in its proper place.</p>

<p>The Prince then having consulted with his
advisers—and the principal of these were the Duke
of Marlborough, Lord Carteret and Mr. Pulteney—decided
to appeal to Parliament to petition the King
to grant him that same income as Prince of Wales,
which he himself received from George the First.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The first sign of the King’s return home was a
letter received on the early morning of Saturday,
January 14th, by express from his Majesty stating
that after a delay of five weeks at Helvetsluis, he
had at last embarked, and after encountering a
contrary wind all the way, they had tacked until at
last they made Lowestoft, at which port the King
had landed about noon on the previous day.</p>

<p>The news seems to have been held back in the
ante-room while the Queen slept, and here Sir
Robert Walpole and the Prince of Wales appear to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
have met and had a two hours’ chat, whilst they
waited for the Queen to wake.</p>

<p>According to Hervey, most of the talking appears
to have been carried on by Sir Robert, who seems to
have grasped the opportunity to lecture the Prince
in that fatherly manner adopted by old men towards
young ones when their pockets are not affected.
As reported by Hervey, Walpole’s discourse was a
string of sleepy platitudes—he had been roused out
of his bed—peculiarly irritating to the Prince under
the circumstances, which he seems to have listened
to with exemplary patience, but the vital subject of
the increase in his income does not appear to have
been touched upon at all. The next day the King
arrived at St. James’s Palace, and the Queen and
the whole of the Royal Family went down into the
Colonnade to receive him.</p>

<p>Contrary to all expectation he was in an excellent
humour, but suffering from a terrible cold.</p>

<p>He kissed everybody, including the Prince of
Wales, and was at once marched off to bed by his
solicitous spouse, to be doctored for his cold, which
by this time, from long neglect, required careful
nursing. Here in his bedroom he was kept a close
prisoner by the Queen, and very few people were
allowed to see him; those that did, did not come
away with any great opinion either of his health or
his temper, which had not improved by confinement.
Any allusion to his royal health irritated him
beyond measure. Lord Dunmore, one of his Lords<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
of the Chamber, offended in this respect, and was
ordered out. To Lord Pembroke, whom he called to
take his place, he spoke of the erring nobleman as a
troublesome inquisitive “puppy,” a designation very
much in the royal favour at that time; he added
that he and others were always plagueing him about
his health like a parcel of old nurses.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Walpole and others got very anxious
about the King at this time, mainly on account of
the seclusion in which he was kept by the Queen.
He was certainly unwell, suffering undoubtedly
from the reaction after the excitement of his escape
from shipwreck, and perhaps his excesses in
Hanover, for he was getting old; but his indisposition
was but a slight one, and when he came out
from his apartments, which he did just at the time
it suited the Queen to let him, it was found that
his recovery was very rapid indeed.</p>

<p>It is more than probable that the Queen had a
strong reason for keeping up at this time the idea of
his ill-health, and a reason may be easily found for
it, in the following incident.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt whatever, although, according
to Hervey, she strenuously denied it, that
during the summer of 1736, the Prince of Wales
soon after his marriage appealed to his mother on
the subject of his financial position, and that at the
same time he informed her of his intention to seek
the aid of Parliament to obtain his full allowance of
£100,000 a year as Prince of Wales, and a jointure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
for the Princess. The circumstance is recorded both
by Lord Hardwicke, the Lord Chancellor, in his
papers, and by Doddington in his diary.</p>

<p>The Queen affected to receive the announcement
airily, and to laugh it off, according to the Prince’s
description of the interview, but nevertheless she
may have taken the matter to heart more seriously
than she pretended, and knowing that Parliament
was to meet almost immediately after the King’s
return; it is quite possible that she made the most
of the King’s indisposition to keep the Prince and
his Party from bringing the matter of the income
forward. If she did, she made a miscalculation, for
many votes probably went the Prince’s side on
account of this supposed uncertainty of the King’s
life, and the probable accession of the Prince to the
throne.</p>

<p>It was, however, only a few days before the
motion was made in the House of Commons that
definite information reached the Court, through
Lord Hervey, as usual, that the Prince intended to
lay the dispute between himself and his father concerning
his income before Parliament.</p>

<p>Lord Hervey begged the Queen not to tell the
King that night as it might disturb his rest and set
him fuming, but to break it gently to him in the
morning; this she did, when the King took the
news much more calmly than was expected, and in
fact showed much less concern than the Queen all
through.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>Then began a state of excitement which divided
the country into two great parties, those for the
King, and those for the Prince, which latter was by
far the larger party.</p>

<p>But as in the present day, but still a great deal
more so then, the House of Commons was divided
by many interests, principally the interests of the
individuals who sat there.</p>

<p>For a King to be sending about in the House,
bribing members with actual hard cash to vote for
him, seems a very shocking thing in our eyes, but it
was not uncommon then. In addition there was a
strong party among the Tories—at whose head was
Sir William Wyndham—who regarded the Prince’s
application to Parliament as a motion injurious to
the constitution, and who, while sympathizing with
him and determined not to vote against him, yet
hesitated to commit themselves by voting for him.
But the Prince and his Party lost no opportunity to
secure votes; Mr. Pulteney, the leader of the
Opposition was with them hand and glove, and it
certainly appeared, if the Tory party could be
counted upon, that the Prince would gain the
victory, which would have been a crushing blow to
the Court and Walpole. So serious did matters
begin to look that Sir Robert counselled a compromise,
and with great difficulty persuaded the
King—and Queen—to send a message to the Prince
offering to settle Fifty Thousand a year upon him
certain, instead of the present voluntary allowance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
and to give the Princess a jointure—amount not
stated. The following is the text of this document
with which the Lord Chancellor (Lord Hardwicke,
who had only received the Great Seal that morning,
and who did not relish this message to the Prince as
the first act of his Chancellorship), Lord President,
Lord Steward, Lord Chamberlain, Dukes of Richmond,
Argyll<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> and Newcastle, Earls of Pembroke
and Scarborough and Lord Harrington, were sent to
the Prince of Wales:</p>

<p>“His Majesty has commanded us to acquaint your
Royal Highness, in his name, that upon your Royal
Highness’s marriage, he immediately took into
his Royal consideration the settling a proper
jointure upon the Princess of Wales; but his
sudden going abroad and his indisposition since his
return had hitherto retarded the execution of these
his gracious intentions; from which short delay His
Majesty did not apprehend any serious inconvenience
could arise<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>; especially since no application
had in any manner been made to him upon this
subject by your Royal Highness; and that His
Majesty hath now given orders for settling a jointure
upon the Princess of Wales, as far as he is enabled
by law, suitable to her rank and dignity; which he
will in proper time lay before his Parliament in
order to be made certain and effectual for the benefit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
of Her Royal Highness. The King has further
commanded us to acquaint your Royal Highness
that though your Royal Highness has not thought
fit, by any application to His Majesty, to desire that
your allowance of fifty thousand pounds per annum,
which is now paid you by monthly payments, at the
choice of your Royal Highness, preferably to
quarterly payments, might by His Majesty’s further
grace and favour be rendered less precarious. His
Majesty, to prevent the bad consequences which he
apprehends may follow from the <em>undutiful measures</em>,
which His Majesty is informed your Royal Highness
has been advised to pursue, will grant to your
Royal Highness for His Majesty’s life, the said fifty
thousand pounds per annum, to be issuing out of
His Majesty’s Civil List Revenues, over and above
your Royal Highness’s revenues arising from <i>the
Duchy of Cornwall</i>, which His Majesty considers a
very competent allowance, considering his numerous
issue and the great expenses which do and must
necessarily attend an honourable provision for his
whole family.”</p>

<p>Such was the message which the Lord Chancellor,
by command of King George, read over to his son,
in the presence of the nine other noblemen who
accompanied him.</p>

<p>According to the circumstantial account of the
interview given by Lord Hervey, the Prince stepped
up to Lord Hardwicke, who had kissed hands and
been congratulated by him on his appointment as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
Chancellor, and made the following communication
in a “sort of whisper”:</p>

<p>“That he wondered it should be said in the
message that he had made no sort of communication
to the King on this business, when the Queen knew
he had often applied to him through her, and that
he had been forbidden by the King ever since the
audience he asked of his Majesty two years ago
at Kensington, relating to his marriage, ever to
apply to him again any way but by the Queen.”</p>

<p>Upon this communication being repeated to the
Queen, she flew into a violent rage, and called the
Prince a liar!</p>

<p>To this she added, according to Lord Hervey’s
account—which looks very much like his own cooking—a
great deal of special pleading to endeavour
to show that there were no witnesses to prove the
Prince’s assertion. But the plain answer to this is
that it was hardly the sort of communication,
especially passing between mother and son, at which
the Prince would have been likely to have provided
himself with witnesses. Against the Queen’s denial,
we have the record of such a communication having
taken place in the papers of Lord Hardwicke, the
Lord Chancellor, who gives circumstances and the
nature of the interview, and we have also the same
fact mentioned in Doddington’s Diary (Appendix).
In the celebrated interview which took place
between Doddington and the Prince there recorded,
it is clearly shown that the Prince made this statement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
concerning the communication to his mother,
to Doddington on February 8th, 1737, long before
the deputation of his father’s noblemen waited on
him, and that to Doddington he stated that the
interview with the Queen had taken place during
the previous summer. This seems to be a very strong
piece of evidence that the Prince was speaking the
truth and his mother the reverse. In fact from this
time forth her hatred of him seemed to grow
stronger day by day.</p>

<p>But to return to the deputation to the Prince
with the King’s terms of settlement.</p>

<p>If these had not been communicated privately to
him before, Frederick must have known that the
King’s offer really meant very little, and he seemed
quite prepared with his reply. It was at once
taken down as he spoke it, and was as follows:—“That
His Royal Highness desired the Lords to lay
him with all humility at his Majesty’s feet, and to
assure his Majesty that he had, and ever should
retain, the utmost duty for his Royal person; that
His Royal Highness was very thankful for any
instance of his Majesty’s goodness to him or the
Princess, and particularly for his Majesty’s
intention of settling a jointure upon Her Royal
Highness; but that as to the message, the affair was
now out of his hands, and therefore he could give no
answer to it.” After which His Royal Highness
used many dutiful expressions towards his Majesty;
and then added: “Indeed, my Lords, it is in other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
hands—I am sorry for it,” or to that effect. His
Royal Highness concluded with earnestly desiring
the Lords to represent his answer to His Majesty in
the most respectful and dutiful manner.</p>

<p>There does not seem much in this answer to find
fault with in the direction of respect at any rate,
under the circumstances. The interview, however,
ended there, and the Lords withdrew to convey the
Prince’s answer back to his Royal Father in another
part of the same Palace of St. James’s.</p>

<p>Both the King and Queen were enraged at the
reply, and the former commenced at once to abuse
rather roughly Sir Robert Walpole for persuading
him to send it, but the minister sagely answered
that he expected the good result of it not that day
but on the morrow—the day of the Motion in the
House of Commons. He was not wrong for he made
the utmost use of it himself on that occasion in his
speech.</p>

<p>So the agreement between father and son having
fallen through, and everybody being worked up to
the required pitch of excitement, the matter went
forward, and on the next day, February 22nd,
Pulteney made his motion before the House of
Commons, for an address to be presented to the
King, humbly asking for a settlement of £100,000 a
year on the Prince of Wales and the same jointure
on the Princess, as the Queen had when she was
Princess of Wales, giving the King the assurance
that the House would support him in this measure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<p>The strong points of Pulteney’s speech were, the
claim the Prince had to the increase of income,
which he said was founded on equity and good
policy, and a legal right founded on law and
precedent.</p>

<p>He contended that the revenue of the Civil List
had been granted to George the First, and afterwards
added to in the case of George the Second, on
the express—or at any rate implied condition—that
out of the revenue a sum of £100,000 a year should
be set aside for the Prince of Wales. Pulteney is
said to have spoken on the subject with great
ability for an hour and a half, Lord Hervey adding
in his account that in the speech there was “a great
deal of matter and a great deal of knowledge, as
well as art and wit, and yet I cannot but say I have
often heard him speak infinitely better than he did
that day. There was a languor in it, that one
almost always perceives in the speeches that have
been so long preparing and compiling.”</p>

<p>Sir Robert Walpole at once answered and, as
might have been expected almost at the commencement
of his speech, conveyed to the House the
orders he had received from His Majesty to communicate
to them the message he had sent his son
on the previous day. This of course was the reason
of his advising the King to send the message at all.</p>

<p>Sir Robert read aloud the whole of the King’s
message to his son, this magnanimous offer of
something he could not get out of giving, and after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
it the Minister made all he could of the Prince’s
answer:</p>

<p>“Indeed, my Lords, it is in other hands; I am
sorry for it.”</p>

<p>Walpole’s speech was an able one, and for the
most part went to show that the King could really
not afford—out of an income of nearly a million—to
give his son the extra £50,000 per annum, and if he
could, he was not bound to give it by the Settlement
made by Parliament of his Civil List.</p>

<p>But of all the speeches that were made that
evening, by far the most telling was one by a
supporter of the Prince, of which the following
is a summary:</p>

<p>“By the regulation and Settlement of the
Prince’s Household, as made sometime since by His
Majesty himself<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> the yearly expense comes to
£63,000 without allowing one shilling to His Royal
Highness for acts of charity and generosity.</p>

<p>“By the message now before us, it is proposed to
settle upon him only £50,000 a year, and yet from
this sum we must deduct the Land Tax, which, at
two shillings in the pound, amounts to £5,000 a
year, we must likewise deduct the sixpenny duty to
the Civil List Lottery, which amounts to £1,250 a
year, and we must also deduct the fees paid at the
Exchequer, which amount to about £750 a year
more. All these deductions amount to £7,000 a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
year, and reduce the £50,000, proposed to be settled
upon him by the message to £43,000 a year.</p>



<p class="center p2"><span class="figcenter"  id="img010">

</span></p>
<p class="center caption"><i>National Portrait Gallery.</i><span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Spooner &amp; Co.</i></span><br>SIR ROBERT WALPOLE.</p>


<p>“Now, as His Royal Highness has no other
estate but the Duchy of Cornwall, which cannot be
reckoned, at the most, above £9,000, his whole
yearly revenue can amount but to £52,000, and yet
the yearly expense of his Household, according to
His Majesty’s own regulations, is to amount to
£63,000, without allowing His Royal Highness one
shilling for the indulgence of that generous and
charitable disposition with which he is known to be
endued in a very eminent degree. Suppose then
we allow him but £10,000 a year for the indulgence
of that laudable disposition, his whole yearly
expense, by His Majesty’s own acknowledgment,
must then amount to £73,000, and his yearly
income, according to this message, can amount to no
more than £52,000. Is this, sir, showing any
respect to his merit? Is this providing for his
generosity? Is it not reducing him to real want,
even with respect to his necessities, and consequently
to an unavoidable dependence too upon his
father’s Ministers and servants.</p>

<p>“I confess, sir, when I first heard this motion
made, I was wavering a good deal in my opinion;
but this message has confirmed me. I now see, that
without the interposition of Parliament, His Royal
Highness the Prince of Wales, the Heir Apparent
to our Crown, must be reduced to the greatest
straits, the most insufferable hardships.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span></p>

<p>However, despite this statement, after a few more
speeches from Lord Baltimore, Mr. Hedges—both of
the Prince’s Household, and the Master of the Rolls,
who was neither one way nor the other, the House
divided at eleven o’clock, with the result that the
motion in favour of the Prince was negatived by
234 votes to 204. A very close majority considering,
and that was entirely owing to forty-five
Tories rising and leaving the House in a body
without voting.</p>

<p>But the King and Queen were delighted and
heaped renewed abuse upon their son, the very
mildest terms of which were “Puppy” and
“scoundrel.” Congratulations <em>poured</em> in upon the
Royal Parents from the Court Party, not only upon
the rejection of the motion, but upon the small
amount of money it had cost the King in bribes to
the Members of the House of Commons—the matter
seemed to be quite public property, for it was
known that the King had only disbursed £900 in
all; £500 to one man, and £400 to another, and this
in any case would have had to have been given them
at the end of the Session—for selling their constituents’
interests apparently—but they clamoured for
it then. One would have liked to have seen these
two clamouring members of the House.</p>

<p>But the Prince nothing daunted, consented
to the wishes of his friends, and had the same
motion made two days after (February 23rd)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
in the House of Lords by Lord Carteret—who was
a double-faced man, and apologized to the Queen
before he made it, urging that he was <em>forced</em> to
make it, which was not the truth. In the Upper
House, however, the Prince was even less fortunate,
and the motion was lost there by a majority of 103
against 40. But in all the excitement which
prevailed at this time we may be certain of one
thing, and that is that the victorious little King,
with his strong German accent always spoke of the
sum asked for by his son as “dat Puppy’s fifty
sousand pound.”</p>

<p>The Prince, on his part, however the adverse vote
of the House of Commons may have affected him,
certainly did not desire the increase in his income to
come out of the pockets of the British Taxpayer, for
when a suggestion of that nature was made to him
by Doddington at his interview already referred to
on February 8th, that the Fifty Thousand Pounds
should be voted by Parliament apart from the
King’s income, Frederick made the following fine
answer:</p>

<p>“I think the nation has done enough, if not too
much, for the family already; I would rather beg
my bread from door to door than be a further
charge on them.”</p>

<p>The following is the comment of Sarah Duchess
of Marlborough on this affair, written to Lord Stair
at the time:</p>

<p>“1736. A great battle in the Houses of Parliament<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
concerning the revenue which the public pays
to the King to support the Prince of Wales. The
Court carried it by a majority of thirty, not without
the expense of a great deal of money, and a most
shameful proceeding to threaten and fetch sick men
out of their beds to vote, for fear of losing their
bread. But notwithstanding this, the minority for
the Prince was two hundred and four; and a great
many other members who would have been in it if
they had been in town. A great many charming
truths were said on that side; no justice or common
sense was expressed on the other. The speakers on
the majority were Sir Robert, Horace, Sir W. Yonge,
Pelham, and somebody of the Admiralty that I
have never heard of before. I am confident that
though the Prince lost the question, the ministers
were mightily frighted, and not without reason, for
it is a heavy-weight two hundred and four, who
were certainly on the right side of the question—and
I am apt to think, that men who have been so
base with estates and so mean as to act against the
interests of their country, will grow very weary of
voting to starve the next heir to the crown;
since the generality of the majority has a view only
to their own interest, and it is apprehended that the
King is in so bad a state of health, that though he
has got over his illness so far as sometimes to appear
in public, yet we shall not be so happy as to have
him live long; and everybody that sees him tells me
that he looks at this time extremely ill. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
Prince in all this affair has shown a great deal of
spirit and sense, and the intolerable treatment
which he has had for so many years will no doubt
continue him to be very firm, and to act right.</p>

<p>“House of Lords:—Proxies and all but forty for
the Prince, and a majority of near three to one on
the other side. Nobody surprised at that. I really
think that they might pass an Act there, if they
pleased, to take away Magna Charta. ’Tis said
they don’t intend to turn out anybody in the King’s
service who voted in this question for the Prince in
either House. If they don’t, I think <em>that</em> shows
some fear.</p>

<p>“I am never very sanguine, and for a long time
could not imagine which way the liberties of England
could be saved. But I really do think now
there is a little glimmering of daylight.”</p>

<p>The King and Queen in the jubilation of their
victory over the Prince of Wales had a mind to
celebrate it by turning him and his young wife out
of St. James’s Palace, but they were dissuaded from
this benevolent intention by the judicious Sir Robert
Walpole. Instead the Prince retained his position—though
no doubt he would have much preferred a
house of his own—but the state of affairs under
these circumstances must have reached the limit of
painfulness to the young Princess and her husband.</p>

<p>Each night “he led the Queen by the hand to
dinner,” says Doran, “and she could have stabbed
him on the way; for her wrath was more bitter
than ever against him, for the reason that he had
introduced her name, through his friends, in the
Parliamentary debate.”</p>

<p>This referred presumably to his mention of the
fact that he had told his mother of his embarrassments.</p>

<p>The Prince still attended his father’s levees
occasionally, but the King never acknowledged his
presence in any way whatever. Very soon, however,
at the conclusion of the session of Parliament, the
Court moved to Richmond, and there the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
King, now quite restored to health, distinguished
this year 1737 by another gracious act; he took
still another mistress. This time the object of his
Royal selection was the children’s governess, Lady
Deloraine.</p>

<p>The lady in question was Mary Howard—the
King seemed to favour the name of Howard in his
amours—of the Suffolk family, who had married
Henry Scott, first Earl of Deloraine; but at this
period he was dead and she had remarried William
Wyndham, Esq., of Cassham.</p>

<p>She was an extremely pretty woman, but celebrated
for the looseness of her talk in that age of
looseness. She was not a woman of much brain
power, and a fair estimate of her character may be
formed from the following incident.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Walpole came across her one day in
the Hall at Richmond while she was dangling her
little boy of about twelve months in her arms, and
made the following characteristic remark—“That’s
a very pretty boy, Lady Deloraine, whose is it?”
Her ladyship, nothing abashed, took the enquiry in
the spirit in which it was offered, and replied before
a group of people—“Mr. Wyndham’s, upon honour;”
and then laughingly continued, “but I will not
promise whose the next shall be!”</p>

<p>Continuing the discourse later in private with Sir
Robert Walpole, she pretended that she had not
yet yielded to the King’s importunities, and
remarked that “she was not of an age to act like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
a vain or a loving fool, but if she did consent she
would be well paid.” She added naively to Sir
Robert—who himself had a mistress, the well known
Miss Skerrett, whom he adored and afterwards
married—“nothing but interest should bribe her;
for as to love she had enough of that, as well as a
younger man at home; and that she thought old
men and Kings ought always to be made to pay
well!” Her empty head and want of morals led
her to boast freely at this time; she confided in the
well known Lady Sundon, with whom she had a
very slight acquaintance, that the King had been
very importunate these two years, and had often
told her how unkind she was to refuse him, that it
was mere crossness, for that he was sure her
husband (Mr. Wyndham, who was sub-governor to
the Duke of Cumberland) would not take it at all ill.</p>

<p>She made a similar communication to Lord
Hervey, abruptly one day at Richmond, at this time
before a room full of people: “Do you know the
King has been in love with me these two years?”
she queried.</p>

<p>At which Lord Hervey, rather taken aback,
answered, to turn the conversation, “Who is not in
love with you?”</p>

<p>He himself certainly was not, for this is how he
sums her up in his Memoirs:</p>

<p>“Her Ladyship was one of the vainest as well as
one of the simplest women that ever lived; but to
this wretched head there was certainly joined one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
the prettiest faces that ever was formed, which,
though she was now five and thirty,<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> had a bloom
upon it too, that not one woman in ten thousand
has at fifteen.” This was Horace Walpole’s opinion
of Lady Deloraine: “A pretty idiot, with most of
the vices of her own sex, and the additional one of
ours—drinking.</p>

<p>“Yet this thing of convenience on the arrival of
Lady Yarmouth, Madame Walmoden, put on all
that dignity of passion, which even revolts real
inclination.”</p>

<p>Lady Deloraine, however, went on her way
rejoicing at this time, and as the summer wore
on and the King showed no signs of returning to
Hanover and Madame de Walmoden, openly boasted
that she was keeping him in England.</p>

<p>She did not, however, appear to derive much
substantial profit from her position, as the following
incident, related by Sir Robert Walpole to the
Queen, will show; neither had the King forgotten
Madame de Walmoden.</p>

<p>George had ordered Walpole one day to buy one
hundred lottery tickets, and to charge the amount,
£1,000, to the Secret Service Fund, an atrocious
robbery of the public!</p>

<p>Walpole, having carried out his commission without
a murmur, confided the transaction to Lord
Hervey, mentioning that it was for the King’s
favourite.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span></p>
<p>Hervey, thinking he meant Lady Deloraine, commented:
“I did not think he went so deep there,”
referring to the amount.</p>

<p>“No,” Walpole corrected, “I mean the Hanover
woman. You are right to imagine that he does not
go so deep to his lying fool here. He will give her
a couple of the tickets and think her generously
used.”</p>

<p>By which it seems that the King’s German
women had by far the better knack of getting
money out of him than the English favourites.</p>

<p>But Walpole’s sagacity had, just previous to this,
at the end of the Parliamentary Session, brought
the question of the Prince of Wales’s income
adroitly into something of a settlement. He had
with the greatest difficulty induced the King and
Queen to agree to a settlement of the £50,000 a
year mentioned in the King’s celebrated message to
the Prince, and the difficulty of the other £50,000
a year claimed by Frederick was got over by
Parliament being persuaded to settle an extra large
jointure on the Princess of Wales, £50,000 a year in
fact. So the parsimonious little King got out of
paying it after all.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.<br><span class="small"><span class="smcap">A Most Extraordinary Event.</span></span></h2></div>


<p>We now approach some of the most extraordinary
events of the Prince’s life, those circumstances
surrounding the birth of his first child.</p>

<p>There had been a great deal of speculation, which
was very natural under the circumstances, as to the
probability of the Princess of Wales bearing a
child, and the Queen and the Princess Caroline are
said to have formed an opinion, for reasons unknown,
that she never would. In all probability
the wish in this case was father to the thought, for
the coming of a lineal heir to the crown through the
Prince of Wales, was an event not desired by the
King or Queen, who it was well known desired the
crown for the Duke of Cumberland, now a handsome
boy of sixteen.</p>

<p>It was therefore no doubt owing to this reason
that neither the Prince or Princess of Wales appeared
to be in any hurry to publicly announce this
event. As a matter of fact the first formal intimation
of it was conveyed in the following letter
from the Prince to his royal mother, sent by Lord
North, his Lord of the Bedchamber then in waiting.</p>

<p>Lord Hervey relates in his Memoirs that on the
occasion of the next visit of the Princess to the
Court, she was subjected by the Queen to a series of
questions, perhaps quite natural under the circumstances.
To these questions she received from the
Princess of Wales but one answer throughout:—“I
don’t know.”</p>

<p>Being at last wearied with this continual repetition
of the same response, she changed the
subject. But in the light of other events it is
perfectly clear that the Princess had her answer
prepared beforehand, and was determined she would
give the Queen as little information on the subject
as possible. There cannot be a doubt that the
Prince and Princess had made their minds up
together on this point, and that they had some very
good reason for it.</p>

<p>What was that reason?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<p>A study of the events that followed will probably
disclose the answer.</p>

<p>The most circumstantial record of these events is
undoubtedly that given by Lord Hervey, though
written with great bias, and his usual endeavour to
blacken the Prince’s character as much as possible.</p>

<p>There appears to have been a strong desire on the
part of the King and Queen that the Princess’s
lying-in should take place at Hampton Court, and
an equally strong determination on the part of the
Prince and Princess that it should not. This intense
desire of the King and Queen that the young
Princess should lie-in at Hampton Court seems to
have exceeded all bounds.</p>

<p>So much did the Queen work upon the feelings of
the King and Sir Robert Walpole—she seems to
have been the Prime mover—that it was decided to
send a message to the Prince of Wales <em>commanding</em>
that the Princess should lie-in at Hampton Court.
They seem to have had some insane idea that there
would be a supposititious child, though why this
should be needed, in the case of a healthy young
man and woman, never transpired. The message,
however, was never sent, according to Lord Hervey,
though some writers say it was. If it was not it
was certainly owing to the wisdom of Walpole.</p>

<p>“At her labour I will positively be,” remarked
the Queen, “for she cannot be brought to bed
as quick as one can blow one’s nose, and I will be
sure it is her child.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p>What was the reason of this absurd anxiety?</p>

<p>It is impossible to say with certainty what was
passing in the minds of these young people at this
time; the girl wife of eighteen, and her husband
who, among all his many relatives, could not rely
upon one as a friend. There must, however, have
been some very strong motive—a feeling which they
held in sympathy, to have caused them to have
acted as they did.</p>

<p>The Court in the meantime had removed from
Richmond—the old palace down by the river near
Kew<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> to Hampton Court, and with it the Prince
and Princess of Wales with their household as
usual. The Court had gone on its usual humdrum
way, one long summer’s day being, in its regular
routine of walks, drives, bowls and cards in the
evening, as much like another as possible, in the
manner so bitterly complained of by Lady Suffolk in
her last days at Court.</p>

<p>Everything went on as usual, and the accouchement
of the Princess was looked upon by everyone
as being a yet far off event.</p>

<p>So matters stood until Sunday, the 31st of July,
1737. This is the account given by Lord Hervey
of the amusements on the evening of that day:</p>

<p>“The King played at commerce below stairs, the
Queen above at quadrille, the Princess Emily at her
commerce table, and the Princess Caroline and Lord
Hervey at cribbage, just as usual, and separated all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
at ten o’clock; and what is incredible to relate, went
to bed all at eleven, without hearing one single
syllable of the Princess’s being ill, or even of her not
being in the house.”</p>

<p>So the whole household retired to rest and peace
reigned over the ancient mansion of Cardinal
Wolsey. But not for long. At half-past one a
courier arrived at the Palace, and eventually succeeded
in arousing one of the Queen’s Women of the
Bedchamber, a certain Mrs. Tichborne, who forthwith,
on hearing what the courier had to say, went
straight off to their Majesties’ sacred bedroom, and
awakened them.</p>

<p>The Queen, on her entering the chamber, started
up, and very naturally enquired whether the house
was on fire.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tichborne, having eased the Royal mind on
this point, proceeded to give the Queen, as best she
could, information on a very delicate subject. She
said the Prince had sent to let their Majesties know
the Princess was in labour.</p>

<p>The suddenness of this communication produced
the effect upon the Queen which might have been
expected.</p>

<p>“My God!” she cried, starting up, “my night
gown, I’ll go to her this moment.”</p>

<p>“Your night gown, Madam?” repeated Mrs.
Tichborne, thinking it about time she should know
all, “and your coaches too; the Princess is at St.
James’s.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span></p>

<p>“Are you mad,” interrupted the Queen, “or are
you asleep, my good Tichborne? You dream!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Tichborne, however, confirmed her first
assertion, and an excited little nightcap popped up
from the King’s side of the bed, and there came
from beneath it a torrent of very guttural German,
of which the following is a translation:</p>

<p>“You see now, with all your wisdom, how they
have outwitted you. This is all your fault. <em>There
is a false child which will be upon you</em>, and how
will you answer it to all your children? This has
been fine care and fine management for your son
William—he is mightily obliged to you. And for
Ann I hope she will come over and scold you herself.
I am sure you deserve anything she can say
to you.”</p>

<p>This allusion to the Princess Royal referred to an
idea she had that she might succeed to the throne
of England if neither of her brothers married. But
the poor Queen was far too anxious and excited to
pay any attention to her wrathful little royal
spouse; apparently during most of the tirade she
was getting into her clothes the best way she could,
with the assistance of Mrs. Tichborne. While
dressing as fast as possible, she ordered her coaches
and sent messages to the Duke of Grafton and Lord
Hervey to go with her. For to St. James’s she was
going as fast as she could.</p>

<p>At half-past two, the great coaches containing the
Queen, the two eldest Princesses with their ladies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
the Duke of Grafton, Lord Hervey and Lord Essex,
who was to be sent back with news to the King,
rumbled out of the gateway of Hampton Court
Palace and drove off through the summer night
towards London.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>An account is now desirable of what took place
earlier in the evening in the Princess’s apartments
at Hampton Court.</p>

<p>It appears that the Princess of Wales, having
decorously dined in public—in presence of the
household—that Sunday evening, was, on her return
to her own rooms, taken very ill; it soon became
apparent that the pains she was suffering from were
those of labour.</p>

<p>Despite the strong endeavour of Lord Hervey in
his account of this affair to make it appear that the
Prince was forcing his wife to go in the state she
was to St. James’s Palace, it must be distinctly
remembered that the Princess herself stated that the
removal to St. James’s Palace was made at her own
request, and her reason for taking this course will be
shown later.</p>

<p>When it became apparent beyond all doubt that
the Princess was enduring the pains of labour, the
Prince ordered a coach to be secretly got ready;
there is no doubt whatever that provision for this
had been made beforehand.</p>

<p>It appears that by the time the coach was ready
the Princess was suffering a good deal, and had to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
be supported by the Prince, a Mr. Bloodworth, one
of the Prince’s equerries, and by a Monsieur
Desnoyer, a dancing master above all people, who
appears to have been a sort of privileged person,
allowed to roam free over the Palaces.</p>

<p>The whole proceeding was highly indelicate, and
what followed more so; Lady Archibald Hamilton,
and Mr. Townshend, one of the Prince’s Grooms-in-Waiting,
are both said to have protested against
the proceeding, and to have done so very properly.
But why were these young people so anxious to get
away from Hampton Court Palace, that their child
might be born elsewhere? It is perfectly plain that
they had a very strong motive indeed. What was
that motive?</p>

<p>The poor young Princess seems to have been got
down stairs and into the waiting coach with the
greatest difficulty, and was in a terrible plight when
she arrived there, as one might very well expect,
considering her age and the novelty of her condition.
There entered into the coach with her, Lady
Archibald Hamilton and two of her dressers, Mrs.
Clavering and Mrs. Paine. Reid, the Prince’s Valet-de-Chambre,
who also appears to have been a
surgeon, and a man midwife, mounted upon the box,
and Bloodworth the Equerry, and two or three more
mounted behind the coach.</p>

<p>After enjoining secrecy on all his household concerning
his removal—which injunction seems to have
been faithfully heeded—the Prince entered the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
coach and gave the order to drive at a gallop to
St. James’s Palace.</p>

<p>There must have been a pretty scene inside the
coach, considering the Princess’s state, and the
condition of mind, under the circumstances, of
the three ladies in attendance. The Prince seems to
have been in a high state of excitement, and to have
divided his time between trying to comfort his
young wife and using strong language.</p>

<p>About ten o’clock “this cargo,” as Lord Hervey
elegantly describes it, arrived at St. James’s Palace,
where, of course, nothing whatever was ready for the
Princess’s accouchement. The only attendant there,
and that a very necessary one, was the midwife,
and she appeared in a few minutes, having evidently
been warned beforehand. There were not even
sheets ready for the Princess, and it is said
that the Prince and one of the ladies aired two
tablecloths, between which the Princess was put
to bed.</p>

<p>There should, of course, have been present at this,
the birth of a direct heir to the Crown, some of the
Lords of the Council, but Lord Wilmington, and
Lord Godolphin, Privy Seal, somehow appeared
mysteriously upon the scene. It seems, however,
that Lord Wilmington had received a message from
the Prince at his house at Chiswick, and came at
once. At a quarter before eleven, within three
quarters of an hour of her arrival, the Princess
was delivered of what Lord Hervey delicately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
describes as “a little rat of a girl, about the bigness
of a good large tooth-pick case.”</p>

<p>Mark the hearty welcome extended to this little
stranger by the King and Queen’s confidant!</p>

<p>It may be here mentioned that the “little rat”
grew into an exceedingly pretty girl, but with a
peculiar gift of unintentionally upsetting people,
which was supposed to be a result of her mother’s
trials at her birth. She became Duchess of Brunswick,
and died in 1813.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was four o’clock before the Queen’s Party
reached St. James’s Palace, and then being told, in
answer to an enquiry, that the Princess was very
well, concluded that nothing had happened. However,
the Queen, to whom this whole affair must
have been a great trial—for she was in very bad
health—ascended the stairs to the Prince’s apartments,
and Lord Hervey considerately promised to
get her a fire and some chocolate in his own room.
As she parted from him she made this most extraordinary
remark, which can be taken as a sample of
the unreasonable fear and hatred towards their son
which had obsessed the minds of the King and
Queen.</p>

<p>“To be sure,” replied the Queen, referring to the
chocolate and the fire, “I shall not stay long; I
shall be mightily obliged to you”; then winked and
added: “nor you need not fear my tasting anything
in this side of the house.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span></p>

<p>The Prince received his mother and sisters in
what is described by Lord Hervey as his night gown
and night cap, but what we should more correctly
describe as a dressing gown perhaps; he kissed the
Queen’s hand and cheek in German fashion, and
then broke the news to her of the birth of his
daughter.</p>

<p>Then there appears to have ensued a passage of
words between mother and son as to why a
messenger had not been sent to Hampton Court
before to acquaint the King and herself of the
happy event, as she had not left until more than
three hours after the birth of the child.</p>

<p>To this the Prince replied that he <em>had</em> sent a
messenger as soon as he could write the news, and
this may very well have happened, as the journey
took the Queen an hour and a half, with no doubt
four horses to each coach.</p>

<p>The Queen went into the Princess’s bedchamber,
and seems to have greeted her kindly and congratulated
her.</p>

<p>“Apparrement, Madame,” she observed, “vous
avez horriblement souffert.”</p>

<p>“Point de tout,” answered the Princess; “ce
n’est rien.” Then the “little rat” was brought in
by Lady Hamilton and duly kissed by the royal
grandmother:</p>

<p>“Le bon Dieu,” she remarked, piously, “vous
benisse pauvre petite creature! Vous voila arrivée
dans un disagrèable monde!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span></p>

<p>The little one had not then been dressed, and was
wrapped up in a red mantle.</p>

<p>The Prince appears to have excitedly but
perfectly openly narrated to his mother the circumstances
of the journey, freely admitting that on the
previous Monday and Friday he had also carried the
Princess to London, thinking then that the event
was imminent.</p>

<p>The birth having taken place he seems to have
made no secret of their desire that the accouchement
of the Princess should take place in London.</p>

<p>Lord Hervey, in his account, goes very fully into
details, too much so, perhaps, to suit modern ideas
of delicacy, but the Prince made no secret to his
mother that at one time he thought that he should
have had to take his wife into some house on
the road, so imminent did the event seem.</p>

<p>To his long account the Queen answered not a
word, but turned the shafts of her wrath upon Lady
Hamilton, who was standing by with the baby.</p>

<p>“At the indiscretion of young fools who knew
nothing of the dangers to which this poor child and
its mother were exposed, I am less surprised; but
for you, my Lady Archibald, who have had ten
children, that with your experience, and at your
age, you should suffer these people to act such a
madness, I am astonished, and wonder how you
could, for your own sake as well as theirs, venture to
be concerned in such an expedition.”</p>

<p>Lady Archibald made the Queen no answer to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
this address, which sounded rather like a rebuke
to one of her own dependents, which Lady Archibald
probably really was. The latter turned to the
Prince and simply remarked:</p>

<p>“You see, sir.”</p>

<p>Lord Hervey appears to have received an account
of this interview direct from the Queen and
Princesses when they were partaking of the
chocolate he had had prepared for them in his room,
and we may take it that any conversation unfavourable
to them was discreetly left out.</p>

<p>The Duke of Grafton, Lord Essex and Lord
Hervey, were then admitted to see the baby, and
the Queen withdrew with this very considerate
remark to the Princess of Wales after embracing her:</p>

<p>“My good Princess, is there anything you want,
anything you wish or anything you would have me
do? Here I am, you have but to speak and ask,
and whatever is in my power that you would have
me do, I promise you I will do it.”</p>

<p>The Prince accompanied her to the foot of the
stairs where he parted from his mother, who walked
across the courtyard to Lord Hervey’s lodgings.
Arrived there she made the following characteristic
and elegant observation to the two Princesses and
the Duke of Grafton, and Lord Hervey who accompanied
her:</p>

<p>“Well, upon my honour, I no more doubt this
poor little bit of a thing is the Princess’s child than
I doubt of either of these two being mine; though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
I own to you I had my doubts upon the road
that there would be some juggle, and if instead of
this poor little ugly she-mouse there had been a
brave, large, fat, jolly boy, I should not have been
cured of my suspicions.”</p>

<p>And now comes the great question which has
puzzled everybody from that day to this, and to
which only the feeblest and most unsatisfying
answers have been given.</p>

<p>Why did the Prince and Princess take all this
trouble in removing from Hampton Court in order
that their child might be born in London?</p>

<p>That they had made their preparations beforehand
in providing the nurse who appeared at a few
minutes’ notice cannot be doubted, and that, like the
careless young people that they were, they left out
many of the essentials—such as the sheets—is also
evident. Why did they take all this trouble?</p>

<p>Some historians state that it was simply a studied
act of disobedience to the King and Queen.</p>

<p>If that were so, then it was a most inconvenient
mode of showing it, and the same end might have
been achieved at much less trouble to themselves.</p>

<p>Others—and Lord Hervey amongst them—describe
it as a pure act of bravado and arrogance to
show the Prince’s independence. If this were the
true reason then the Prince must have been an
inhuman brute, and we know from a great many
instances of his kindness and undoubted affection
for his young wife, that he was <em>not</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span></p>

<p>No, to venture an opinion of the real reason for
this most extraordinary proceeding, we must review
a few simple facts. In the first place the true
position of the Prince of Wales with regard to his
parents and the rest of the Royal Family, must
have been well known to the Princess Augusta
before she came to England at all. She knew full
well, in common with most continental Princesses,
that the heir to the throne of England was by no
means a favourite with his parents and that he was
only brought over from Hanover because the
English people demanded it. He was not <em>wanted</em>
by the Royal Family, they wanted the crown of
England for the handsome second son, William
Duke of Cumberland, afterwards adorned with the
additional title of “The Butcher of Culloden.”</p>

<p>Frederick was not handsome though he had a
charm of manner, chiefly owing to his amiability
and kind-heartedness which endeared him to the
people. William had none of these attributes, he
was handsome, and very like his mother—a glance
at their portraits will show that—and he also had
an exceedingly cruel nature, which perhaps the
people soon found out.</p>

<p>Any doubt which may exist in a reader’s mind as
to the preference of King George the Second and
his Queen for their second son, may be set at rest by
a glance at the following account of certain events
which took place in the reign of George the First:</p>

<p>“George I. in his enmity to George II. entertained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
some idea of separating the sovereignty of
England and Hanover (Coxe’s Walpole, p. 132) and
we find from Lord Chancellor King’s <i>Diary</i>, under
the date of June, 1725, ‘a negotiation had been
lately on foot in relation to the two young Princes,
Frederick and William. The Prince (George II.)
and his wife were for excluding Prince Frederick,
but that after the King and the Prince, he would be
Elector of Hanover and Prince William, King of
Great Britain; but that the King said it would be
unjust to do it without Prince Frederick’s consent,
who was now of an age to judge for himself, and so
the matter now stood.’ (Campbell’s Chancellors
IV. 318). Sir Robert Walpole, who communicated
this to the Chancellor, added that he had told
George I. that ‘if <em>he</em> did not bring Prince Frederick
over in his lifetime, he would never set his foot on
English ground.’”<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>This early enmity of his parents to Frederick,
Lord Campbell cannot explain.</p>

<p>So that it is quite clear that but for the intervention
of his grandfather, George the First (about
the only disinterested friend he ever had) Frederick
would have been left to the tender mercies of his
father and mother who would very certainly have
deprived him of his birthright in favour of their
handsome second boy. The Princess of Wales’s
reception in England had not been of that warm
description to convey to her the idea that her
coming had been particularly desired. It will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
remembered that she remained at Gravesend for
forty-eight hours without any of the Royal Family
coming near her at all except Frederick. She very
soon realized the state of affairs, and there is something
pitiable about the young girl of seventeen,
casting herself at the feet of George the Second and
his wife as if to propitiate them, in spite of their
disinclination to receive her.</p>

<p>No, it was very soon made plain to the young
Princess of Wales that her husband was not wanted
here at all, nay that he was hated for standing in
the way of his handsome brother, and that she, too,
this despised Prince’s wife, was not wanted either.</p>

<p>To a girl of her keen perception, for it was shown
by her conduct on her arrival that she was exceedingly
intelligent, it cannot be for a moment doubted
that as those anxious moments of imminent motherhood
drew near she painfully realized too, that
her baby was <em>not wanted either</em>, to be another
stumbling block in the way of the favourite son.</p>

<p>It is not at all an uncommon thing for young
married people to have this overstrung sense of
anxiety for their coming little one, and to conjure up
in their minds fears for which, perhaps, there is no
reason. It cannot be said for a moment that the
King and Queen had any designs on the life of the
coming grandchild, although it was a barbarous age,
when life was held much cheaper than it is now, and
the life of a little baby—especially a “little rat”—did
not count for much. Even King George himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
used to say there were not half enough hangings,
and that if they came into his hands he would not
spare them, although God knows at that time men
and women were strung up in rows outside the gaols
in numbers sufficient to satisfy the most bloodthirsty
advocate of capital punishment.</p>

<p>No, there cannot be a reasonable doubt that this
night journey of the Prince and Princess was undertaken
in an unreasoning panic maybe, but in an
honest fear that the life of their coming little one was
not safe at Hampton Court Palace, and that at any
risk to themselves they would have the birth of the
child take place in surroundings over which they
had entire control, even though, as it happened, the
royal child should be born between two tablecloths
instead of sheets.</p>

<p>This act of the Prince and Princess of Wales was
construed into such a flagrant violation of the Royal
Will, that the enraged little King at once took steps
to assert his authority. Fortunately in these days
Princesses of Wales are not peremptorily ordered to
arrange their <i lang="fr">accouchements</i> in places agreeable to
the Royal Will.</p>

<p>They arrange them just wherever they like.</p>

<p>A brisk interchange of letters took place between
the King and his eldest son, which ended in a somewhat
abrupt command from the King to the Prince
to remove himself and his family out of St. James’s
Palace, which possibly was an order which the
Prince and his wife were not at all sorry to obey; it
gave them the opportunity of setting up their own
home.</p>

<p>(From the King at Hampton Court Palace to the
Prince of Wales at St. James’s, by Lord Dunmore,
August 20th, 1737).</p>

<p>“It being now near three weeks since the Princess
was brought to bed, his Majesty hopes that there
can be no inconvenience to the Princess if Monday,
the twenty-ninth, be appointed for baptising the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
Princess, his grand-daughter; and having determined
that His Majesty the King, the Queen and
the Duchess-Dowager of Saxe-Gotha shall be godfather
and godmothers, will send his Lord Chamberlain
to represent himself and the Queen’s Lady of
the Bedchamber to represent the Queen, and desires
that the Princess will order one of the Ladies of her
Bedchamber to stand for the Duchess-Dowager of
Saxe-Gotha, and the King will send to the Archbishop
of Canterbury to attend and perform the
ceremony.” (p. 225, Hervey.)</p>

<p>To which the Prince dutifully replied:</p>

<p>These letters are written, as the Prince wrote
them in bad French badly spelt.</p>

<p>Lord Hervey states that the morning after these
two epistles were received, was occupied with conversation
between the King and Queen and Sir
Robert Walpole, which on the part of His Majesty
consisted largely of the following epithets which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
applied to his son the Prince of Wales: “<i>Scoundrel
and Puppy!</i>” “<i>Knave and Fool!</i>” “<i>Liar and
coward!</i>” and no doubt many choice German
expletives thrown in where English failed.</p>

<p>The King, eventually, however, commanded the
following answer to be sent by the hands of Lord
Essex, to his son’s happy announcement of the birth
of his daughter. This is what Lord Essex read out
to the Prince:</p>

<p>“The King has commanded me to acquaint your
Royal Highness that His Majesty most heartily
rejoices at the safe delivery of the Princess; but
that your carrying away her Royal Highness from
Hampton Court, the then residence of the King, the
Queen and the Royal Family, under the pains—and
certain indication of immediate labour to the
imminent danger, and hazard both of the Princess
and her child, and after sufficient warnings for a
week before to have made the necessary preparations
for the happy event without acquainting
his Majesty or the Queen with the circumstances
the Princess was in, or giving them the least notice
of your departure, is looked upon by the King to
be such a deliberate indignity offered to himself and
the Queen, that he has commanded me to acquaint
your Royal Highness that he resents it to the
highest degree, and <em>will not see you</em>.”</p>

<p>But this time the worry proved too much for the
Queen, whose health was fast failing, and she was
seized with a violent attack of the gout.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span></p>

<p>However, she had her comforter in her close
attendant, Lord Hervey; and this time she broke
through all rules of etiquette and admitted him to
the sick room to sit by her bed. Here he made
himself agreeable and amusing as usual, and did not
forget to keep alive the Queen’s resentment against
her son.</p>

<p>The Prince of Wales very dutifully sent Lord
North to inquire after his mother’s health. This
message seemed to annoy Lord Hervey, who, in his
petty way, was probably jealous. He offered to
write a much more sincere message—from his point
of view—than the Prince had really sent.</p>

<p>He went into the next room with the Princess
Caroline and wrote the following abominable doggerel
rhymes.</p>

<p>The Griff<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> to the Queen:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">I send my Lord North notwithstanding our strife,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Pour savoir au vrai, comment on se porte.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For ’tis rumoured in town—I hope ’tis not true</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Your foot is too big for your slipper or shoe.</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span></p>
<p>And yet Lord Hervey considered himself a poet!</p>

<p>Of course the gentle insinuation intended in his
lines was that the Prince hoped that the gout would
fly to the Queen’s head or stomach and kill her.</p>

<p>Poor soul! she had a much more fatal malady,
which she bore in secret, and which even Lord
Hervey, her constant companion, knew nothing of.</p>

<p>It is said that the Queen was greatly entertained
by these verses!</p>

<p>Lord Hervey and Pope the Poet were by no means
good friends.</p>

<p>Pope very savagely attacked both his verses and
his character. The former he refers to in speaking
of a supposed charge of weakness against his own
verses. He says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The Lines are weak another’s pleased to say</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lord Fanny spins a thousand such a day.”<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">and</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Like gentle Fanny’s was my flow’ry theme</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A painted mistress or a purling stream.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>These allusions stung Lord Hervey’s shallow feelings.
This was his idea of a refined and witty rejoinder.</p>

<p>“To the imitator of the Satires of the Second
Book of Horace.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Thus whilst with coward hand you stab a name</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And try at least t’ assassinate our fame;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like the first bold assassins be thy lot;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And ne’er be thy guilt forgiven or forgot;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But as thou hat’st, be hated by mankind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And with the emblems of thy crooked mind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Marked on thy back, like Cain, by God’s own hand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wander like him accursed through the land.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>
<p>Which reminds one, somehow, of the lines one
used to hear in the old-fashioned Christmas pantomimes
given out by the Demon. But these were
very cruel and in bad taste considering Pope was a
cripple.</p>

<p>But in the same poem, Lord Hervey refers to the
poet’s affliction again:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“None thy crabbed numbers can endure</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hard as thy heart, and as thy birth obscure.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pope, as will be seen was, however, quite equal to
a rejoinder in the same strain.</p>

<p>It is stated by Lord Hailes that Lord Hervey
having suffered some attacks of epilepsy dieted
himself—or rather starved himself—after in the
following extraordinary manner; his daily food
consisted of a small quantity of asses’ milk and
a flour biscuit. This stayed the progress of the
terrible disease, but it gave him a very ghastly
complexion. He is also stated to have used emetics
daily, which, under the circumstances, appeared
hardly necessary. Once a week he took the indulgence
of an apple.</p>

<p>To hide his cadaverous appearance, he painted his
face as it has been already stated.</p>

<p>None of these weaknesses seem to have been
overlooked by Pope in his reply to Hervey whom he
satirized as “Sporus”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Let Sporus tremble! what! that thing of silk!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sporus that mere white curd of asses’ milk!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Satire or sense, alas! can Sporus feel?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet let me flap this bug with gilded wings</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">This painted child of dirt that stinks and stings</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose buzz the witty and the fair annoys</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet wit ne’er tastes and beauty ne’er enjoys;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So well bred spaniels civilly delight</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In mumbling of the game they dare not bite,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Eternal smiles his emptiness betray</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As shallow streams run dimpling all the way</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whether in florid impotence he speaks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And as the prompter breathes, the puppet squeaks;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or at the ear of Eve, familiar toad</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Half froth, half venom, spits himself abroad.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In puns or politics, in tales or lies</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or spite, or smut or rhymes, or blasphemies;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His wit all see-saw between that and this</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now high, now low, now master up, now miss.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And he, himself, one vile antithesis.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Amphibious thing! that acting either part</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The trifling head or the corrupted heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fop at the toilet, flatterer at the Board</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Beauty that shocks you, parts that none will trust</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wit that can creep and pride that licks the dust.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>To this apparently Lord Hervey vouchsafed no
retort, so Pope was adjudged to have been the
victor in the affair. But not content with this, he
wrote an open letter in prose to Lord Hervey. But
this was suppressed, as Queen Caroline got hold of
a copy of it, and desired Pope not to publish it, as
it held her dear friend and companion up to the
most cutting ridicule. She hated Pope for this, but
concealed her rage lest worse should come of it.
But Lord Hervey’s duels were not all confined to
poetry; he had one with Pulteney, and the weapons
were not words but swords. This occurred in 1730.
It was a squabble over the authorship of a pamphlet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
called “Sedition and Defamation Displayed,” which
attacked both Pulteney and Bolingbroke very
severely, and with the writing of which Hervey was
credited, and unjustly as it turned out eventually.</p>

<p>The heated Pulteney, however, rushed into print,
and published another pamphlet “A Proper Reply
to a late Scurrilous Libel” in which he abused
Walpole and Hervey, referring to the latter by his
nickname of “Lord Fanny,” and depicted him half
man and half woman, dragging in, as was usual, in
those days with execrable taste, certain of Hervey’s
infirmities.</p>

<p>This pamphlet created a perfect fury of anger at
Court, and very naturally aroused the resentment
of Hervey peculiarly susceptible, like many who
indulge in cruel satire about others. He wrote to
Pulteney and demanded to know whether he had
written the pamphlet, and upon Pulteney replying
that he would tell him, when he admitted the
authorship of “Sedition and Defamation Displayed,”
Hervey worked himself up into such a fury, and
was so egged on by the other courtiers—he was not
a fighting man—that he got at last entangled in a
duel with Pulteney.</p>

<p>They met on a fine June afternoon between three
and four o’clock in Upper St. James’s Park, just
behind Arlington Street, Hervey being accompanied
by Fox, and Pulteney by Sir J. Rushout.</p>

<p>There appears to have been some pretty sword
play, and both got slightly wounded—which shows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
that Hervey had some pluck—“but,” writes Mr.
Thomas Pelham, a witness of the affray, “Mr.
Pulteney had once so much the advantage of Lord
Hervey that he would have infallibly run my Lord
through the body if his foot had not slipped, and
then the seconds took the occasion to part them.”</p>

<p>Pulteney, then, in a very magnanimous manner,
appears to have embraced Hervey, and expressed
sorrow at “the accident of their quarrel.”</p>

<p>At the same time he very unnecessarily added
that he would never attack Lord Hervey again
either with his pen or his lips.</p>

<p>Hervey, however, showed his quality by not reciprocating
his kindly feeling, but merely bowed
and sulked.</p>

<p>“And to use a common expression,” concludes
Mr. Pelham, “thus they parted.”</p>

<p>Sir Charles Hanbury Williams wrote some lines
on this duel addressed to Pulteney.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Lord Fanny once did play the dunce</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And challenged you to fight</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And he so stood to lose his blood</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But had a dreadful fright.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Which effusion stamps Sir C. Hanbury Williams
as a poet at once!</p>

<p>But Lord Hervey soon had something more
agreeable to do than even writing poetry or fighting
duels.</p>

<p>There had been a series of letters from the
Prince, already published above, craving his father’s
pardon, and these had, in no way, abated the King’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
wrath. Neither was the Queen touched. But the
King’s message still remained to be agreed upon.
It was at last settled and arranged—in fact a notice
to quit—the Queen being the prime mover and
prompter of Sir Robert Walpole, who, of course,
acted for the King in the matter.</p>

<p>Concerning the final interview between the King
and the Minister, the Queen had stipulated that she
should have the last word with Sir Robert before he
went in to the King, so it may be taken for granted
that the terms of the message to be sent to the
Prince were practically her terms.</p>

<p>Upon leaving the King, Sir Robert Walpole encountered
Lord Hervey whom he told that the
resolution of his Majesty was to leave the child with
the Princess, and not to take it away as George the
First had taken the children of his son, when he
quarrelled with him and turned him out of St.
James’s Palace. The reason given was this:</p>

<p>“<em>Lest any accident might happen to this little
Royal animal, and the world in that case accuse the
King and Queen of having murdered it, for the sake
of the Duke of Cumberland.</em>”<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Sir Robert continued
that he liked to hear other people’s opinions as well
as his own, and then and there desired Lord Hervey
to sit down and write exactly what <em>he</em> would advise
the King to say if he stood in his—Sir Robert’s—position.
This Lord Hervey was overjoyed to do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
as it gave him an opportunity to show his resentment
against the Prince.</p>

<p>It was drawn up in the form of a letter to be
signed by the King as follows, in Lord Hervey’s
words:</p>

<p>“It is in vain for you to hope that I can be so far
deceived by your empty professions, wholly inconsistent
with all your actions, as to think that
they in any manner palliate or excuse a series of
the most insolent and premeditated indignities
offered to me and the Queen, your Mother.</p>

<p>“You never gave the least notice to me or the
Queen of the Princess’s being breeding or with
child till about three weeks before the time when
you yourself have owned you expected her to be
brought to bed, and removed her from the place of
my residence for that purpose. You twice in one
week carried her away from Hampton Court with
an avowed design of having her lie-in in town,
without consulting me or the Queen, or so much as
communicating your intention to either of us. At
your return you industriously concealed everything
relating to this important affair from our knowledge;
and last of all, you clandestinely hurried the
Princess to St. James’s in circumstances not fit to
be named, and less fit for such an expedition.</p>

<p>“This extravagant and undutiful behaviour in a
matter of such great consequence as the birth of an
heir to my crown, to the manifest peril of the
Princess and her child (whilst you pretend your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
regard for her was your motive) inconsistent with
the natural right of all parents, and in violation of
your double duty to me, as your father and as your
King, is what cannot be excused by any false plea,
so repugnant to the whole tenor of your conduct, of
the innocence of your intentions, or atoned for by
specious pretences or plausible expressions.</p>

<p>“Your behaviour for a long time has been so
devoid of duty and regard to me, even before this
last open proof you have given to all the world of
your contempt for me and my authority, that I
have long been justly offended at it; nor will I
suffer any part of any of my palaces to be any
longer the resort and refuge of all those whom discontent,
disappointment or disaffection have made
the avowed opposers of all my measures; who
espouse you only to distress me, and who call you
the head, whilst they make you the instrument of a
faction that acts with no other view than to weaken
my authority in every particular, and can have no
other end in their success but weakening the
common interest of my whole family.</p>

<p>“My pleasure therefore is, that you and all your
family remove from St. James’s as soon as ever the
safety and convenience of the Princess will permit.</p>

<p>“I will leave the case of my grand-daughter to
the Princess till the time comes when I shall think
it proper to give directions for her education.</p>

<p>“To this I will receive no reply. When you
shall, by a consistency in your words and actions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
show that you repent of your past conduct, and are
resolved to return to your duty, parental affection
may then and not till then, induce me to forgive
what parental justice now obliges me to resent.”</p>

<p>So much for Lord Hervey’s idea of what he
considered a just punishment for his enemy the
Prince of Wales.</p>

<p>Coxe, in his “Walpole,” refers to the expressions
in this draft as “harsh, improper and indecorous.”
The Chancellor, Lord Hardwicke, was the chief
reviser of this abominable letter of Hervey’s, and
even when several amendments had been made,
considered it in its completed form too strong, but it
was practically that letter of Lord Hervey’s, though
some of the words were softened, which was
eventually delivered to the Prince of Wales, and
upon which he and his family had to turn out of
St. James’s Palace.</p>

<p>But there is one incident which occurred at this
time and which has been much used by Lord
Hervey, Horace Walpole, and other enemies of the
Prince.</p>

<p>On the ninth day after the confinement of the
Princess of Wales, the Queen, with her two eldest
daughters, drove from Hampton Court to St. James’s
to pay another visit to the mother and child.</p>

<p>It is said that this visit was a very painful one,
because the Queen and her son—who met her only
at the door of his wife’s bedchamber, whether by
accident or design it is not stated—did not speak.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
It is very evident that from this time forward, the
Prince, whether rightly or wrongly, regarded his
mother as the cause of the King’s anger against
him, and did not conceal his feelings on the point.</p>

<p>During the hour which his mother spent with the
Princess and the Royal baby, not a word passed
between mother and son, and exception is taken to
the fact that when the Queen observed that “she
feared she was troublesome,” nobody had the
politeness to say she was not. At the conclusion of
the visit, the Prince very properly led his mother
down to her coach, and arriving at it, did something
which greatly exasperated Lord Hervey and Horace
Walpole; he knelt down in the dirty street and
kissed his mother’s hand!</p>

<p>What a terrible thing for a son to do! What an
outrage!</p>

<p>Both Hervey and Horace Walpole try to make
out that he did it for effect, and to inspire the
people who were looking on; but is it not much
more likely that both Hervey and Walpole—and
perhaps the people in the street, too, would have had
a great deal more to say if he had <em>not</em> done it, for
it was the common etiquette of the Court, and
remains very much the same to the present day.
But there was another interest about this parting,
too. It was the last time that mother and son
ever met on earth.</p>

<p>In such fashion were the sayings and doings of
this Prince, <em>who was not wanted</em>, continually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
distorted by those around the King and Queen, and
yet they never succeeded in shaking his popularity
with the people.</p>

<p>Lord Hardwicke, the Lord Chancellor, has left an
account behind him of an interview with the Prince
about this time, which throws some light on the
reason for the secret removal of the Princess from
Hampton Court.</p>

<p>“On the fourth day of August,” writes Lord
Hardwicke, “the day of proroguing the Parliament,
I went to St. James’s in my way to Westminster in
order to inquire after the health of the Princess of
Wales and the new-born Princess. After I had
performed that ceremony, I went away, and was
overtaken at the further end of Pall Mall by one
of the Prince’s footmen, with a message that His
Royal Highness desired to speak with me. Being
returned, I was carried into the nursery, whither
the Prince came immediately, out of the Princess’s
bedchamber, and turned all the ladies out of the room.”</p>

<p>Shade of Earl Cairns! what should we think
in these days if we heard of the Lord High
Chancellor of England being shown into the
nursery at Marlborough House when on a visit
of ceremony, and “all the ladies being turned
out,” and apparently the baby too, to give
the Prince of Wales an opportunity of talking
serious State matters with his lordship?</p>

<p>The room, however, being at last clear, the Prince
took Lord Hardwicke into his confidence, evidently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
with the object of persuading him to soften the hearts
of the King and Queen and <i lang="la">inter alia</i> referring to the
removal of the Princess from Hampton Court in
much the same terms used in his first letter to his
father, but with this significant addition: “What if
the King, who was apt sometimes to be pretty
quick, should have objected to her going to London,
and an altercation should have arisen, what a
condition would the poor Princess have been in!”</p>

<p>The two sat and discoursed for some time, and
the old Chancellor gave Frederick just the sort of
advice an old lawyer would naturally give a young
man under the circumstances, urging submission and
dutiful behaviour to bring about a union of the
family, and adding that it would be the “zealous
endeavour of himself with the other servants of the
King,” to bring about this end.</p>

<p>“He answered,” continued Hardwicke, “‘My
Lord, I don’t doubt you in the least, for I believe
you to be a very honest man,’ and as I was rising
up embraced me, offering to kiss me. I instantly
kneeled down and kissed his hand, whereupon he
raised me up and kissed my cheek.</p>

<p>“The scene had something in it moving, and my
heart was full of the melancholy prospect that I
thought lay before me, which made me almost burst
into tears. The Prince observed this, and appeared
moved himself, and said: ‘Let us sit down, my
Lord, a little, and recollect ourselves, that we may
not go out thus.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span></p>

<p>“Soon after which I took my leave, and went
directly to the House of Lords.”</p>

<p><i>Minutes of Lord Harrington and Sir Robert
Walpole’s conversation with the Prince by his
bedside, August 1st, about five in the morning, and
taken down in writing about three hours after.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
“August 1, 1737.<br>
</p>

<p>“The Prince of Wales this morning about five
o’clock, when Lord Harrington and Sir Robert
Walpole waited upon him at St. James’s, among
other things said: he did not know whether the
Princess was come before her time or not. That she
had felt great pain the Monday before, which it
being apprehended might prove her labour, of
which opinion Lady Archibald Hamilton and Mrs.
Payne declared themselves to be, but the physicians
were then of another opinion, he brought her from
Hampton Court again. That on the following
Friday the Princess’s pains returning, the Prince
carried her again to St. James’s, when the
physicians, Dr. Hollings and Dr. Broxolme, and
Mrs. Cannons, were of opinion it might prove
her labour, but those pains likewise going off, they
returned again to Hampton Court on Saturday;
that he should not have been at Hampton Court on
Sunday, but it being public day, he feared it might
be liable to some constructions; that the Princess,
growing ill again on Sunday, he brought her away
immediately, that she might be where proper help
and assistance could be had.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span></p>

<p>The opinion of that remarkably sensible woman of
the time, Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, on this
event, can but be read with interest.</p>

<p>“There has been an extraordinary quarrel at
Court. The 31st of last month, July, 1737, the
Princess fell in labour. The King and Queen both
knew she was to lie in at St. James’s, where everything
was prepared. It was her first child, and so
little a way to London that she thought it less
hazard to go immediately away from Hampton
Court to London, where she had all the assistance
that could be, and everything prepared, than to
stay at Hampton Court, where she had nothing, and
might be forced to make use of a country midwife.
There was not a minute’s time to be lost in debating
this matter, nor in ceremonials, the Princess begging
earnestly of the Prince to carry her to St. James’s
in such a hurry that gentlemen went behind the
coach like footmen. They got to St. James’s safe;
and she was brought to bed in one hour after. Her
Majesty followed them as soon as she could, but did
not come until it was all over. However, she expressed
a great deal of anger to the Prince for
having carried her away, though she and the child
were very well. I should have thought it would
have been most natural for a grandmother to have
said, she had been mightily frighted, but she was so
glad it was so well over. The Prince said all the
respectful and dutiful things imaginable to her and
to the King, desiring her Majesty to support the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
reasons which made him go away as he did, without
acquainting his Majesty with it. And I believe
that all human creatures will allow, that this was
natural for a man not to debate a thing of this kind,
nor to lose a minute’s time for ceremony; which
was very useless, considering that it is a great while
since the King has spoken to him, or taken the least
notice of him. The Prince told her Majesty he
intended to go that morning to pay his duty to the
King; but she advised him not. This was Monday
morning, and she said Wednesday was time enough.
And, indeed, I think in that her Majesty was in the
right. The Prince submitted to her counsel, and
only writ a very submissive and respectful letter to
his Majesty, giving his reasons for what he had
done; and this conversation ended, that he hoped
that his Majesty would do him the honour to be
godfather to his daughter, and that he would be
pleased to name who the godmothers would be; and
that he left all the directions of the christening
entirely to his Majesty’s pleasure. The Queen
answered that it would be thought the asking the
King to be Godfather was too great a liberty, and
advised him not to do it.</p>

<p>“When the Prince led the Queen to her coach,
which she would not have had him have done, there
was a great concourse of people; and notwithstanding
all that had passed before, she expressed
so much kindness, that she hugged and kissed him
with great passion. The King after this sent a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
message in writing by my Lord Essex in the
following words:</p>

<p>“‘That his Majesty looks upon what the Prince
had done in carrying the Princess to London in such
a manner, as a deliberate indignity offered to
himself and to the Queen, and resented it in the
highest degree and forbid him the court.’</p>

<p>“All the sycophants and agents of the Court
spread millions of falsities on this occasion, and all
the language there was that this was so great a
crime that even those that went with the Prince
ought to be prosecuted. How this will end nobody
yet knows, at least I am sure I don’t.”</p>

<p>Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough to Lord Stair,
August, 1737.</p>

<p>A pretty satire written before August 29th, 1737,
by Dr. Hollings, who attended the Princess of
Wales, concerning the baby Princess, but really
directed against the Queen.</p>

<p>It is by comparison, not difficult to see on which
side Dr. Hollings’s sympathies were. This writing
was found among the papers of Sarah, Duchess of
Marlborough.</p>

<p>“I am sensible how difficult it really is to be impartial,
and how much more difficult it is to seem so,
in drawing the characters of persons of the highest
path and rank. The praise or the blame which
they may justly deserve, is severally ascribed to the
interested views or the private resentment of the
author. I should therefore not have attempted the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
character of this most excellent Princess, could
there have been the least room for suspicions of that
nature. But having no obligation or disobligation
whatsoever to her, I shall speak the truth in the
sincerity of my heart, and I likewise call upon all
and everyone of those who have the honour to know
her as well as I do, to contradict me if they can in
any one particular. I have observed her with
attention almost from the hour of her birth, and
have carefully marked the progressive steps of
nature. I have seen her in her most unguarded
moments, and have seriously and critically considered
whatever fell from her; so that I may,
without vanity, assert that nobody is better
qualified to tell the truth than myself, though
others might be much more capable of adorning it.</p>

<p>“I shall say nothing of the beauty of this incomparable
Princess, it is her mind, and not her
person, which we intend to delineate. Neither
shall I dwell upon her high birth and station any
longer than to observe that she seems to be the
only person ignorant of that superiority. She has
never been heard to give the most remote hint of it,
much less has she ever been observed to assume
even that degree of state which others, much inferior
to her in birth, are so foolishly fond of.</p>

<p>“It would be saying but little in praise of this
excellent lady to observe, that she had early acquired
many friends; for <em>who</em> in that high station
has not, where the power of obliging and doing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
good is so extensive, it must be the weakest head,
as well as the worst heart, that does not exert it,
and make many happy friends. But, what is much
more rare in her station, she has not one enemy.</p>

<p>“Equally humane to all who approach her, she
neither stoops to meannesses, nor insolently insults,
in proportion as she imagines the persons may be
useful or useless; for having nothing to fear, ask,
or conceal, from any, she behaves herself with unconcern
to all.</p>

<p>“She was never known to tell a lie, or even to disguise
a truth; uncorrupted nature appears in every
motion, and honestly declares the present sentiment.
Her smiles are the immediate results of a contented
and innocent heart. They are never prostituted to
disguise inward rancour and malice, nor insidiously
displayed to betray the unwary into a fatal
confidence.</p>

<p>“The tears she sometimes sheds are not less
sincere; they flow only from justifiable causes, and
not from disappointed avarice, ambition or revenge.
Nor are they the forced tears of simulated compassion,
but real harshness of heart. Moreover she
never cries for joy.</p>

<p>“She is a rare instance of liberality and economy;
for though her income be but small, she retains no
more of it than is absolutely necessary for her
subsistence, and properly and privately disposes of
the rest; free from the ostentation of little or sordid
minds, who by profusion in trifles, hope to conceal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
the insatiate avarice and corruption of their
hearts.</p>

<p>“Though born and bred in Court, she never
engages in the intrigues and whispers of it, nor
concerns herself in public matters. Far from
retailing or inventing lies, promoting scandal and
defamation, and encouraging breach of faith and
violation of friendship, one would think of her
behaviour that she had never heard of such things.</p>

<p>“Her silence, considering her sex, is not the least
admirable of her many qualifications. She never
speaks when she has nothing to say, nor graciously
tires her company with frivolous, improper and
unnecessary tattle.</p>

<p>“She is entirely free from another weakness of
her sex, attention to dress. And it is observable,
that if she is ever out of humour, it is in those
moments when she is obliged to conform to custom
in that particular.</p>

<p>“Having thus finished this imperfect sketch of
this inimitable character, I shall only add for the
information of the curious, that this most incomparable
Princess was given to us on the
31st July, 1737. Name indeed she has none. But
had ever such a Princess a name? Or can any
man name me such a Princess?”</p>

<p>“This paper,” comments the Duchess of Marlborough,
“made me laugh, for I think there is a
good deal of humour in it, and two very exact
characters.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span></p>

<p>Lord Hailes, who published the Duchess’s papers,
comments as follows on this essay of Dr. Hollings:</p>

<p>“It is curious to see the various shapes which
party resentment can assume. We have already
met with a satire on Queen Caroline, in the form
of an inscription to the honour of Queen Anne.
And here more virulent satire appears under a
quibbling character of the infant daughter of the
Prince of Wales.”</p>

<p>If that phenomenon, the soft-hearted old lawyer,
Lord Hardwicke, was moved to tears at the Prince’s
position, that feeling did not extend to the King and
Queen. On the morning of the 13th of September,
the day before the Prince was to leave their roof,
the following edifying remarks were made by them
as they sat at breakfast:</p>

<p>“I hope in God,” piously repeated the Queen
several times as she proceeded with her meal, “I
shall never see him again.”</p>

<p>“Thank God!” responded the King in the same
pious strain—no doubt with his mouth full and
talking very quickly, “to-morrow night the Puppy
will be out of my house!”</p>

<p>The Queen replied that she thought the Prince
would rather like to be made a martyr of; but it
was pointed out to her that the ignominy of being
turned out of doors obscured any martyr-like attributes
in the Prince’s opinion.</p>

<p>This beautiful scene appears to have been a lively
one, for the King, getting excited, gave the company
his opinion on the companions of his eldest son
whom he referred to as “boobies, fools and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
madmen,” and their unlikelihood to represent anything
to him in its proper light.</p>

<p>The King enumerated a few of the Prince’s household
with what he considered appropriate remarks
concerning each of them:</p>

<p>“There is my Lord Carnarvon,<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> a hot-headed,
passionate, half-witted coxcomb, with no more sense
than his master; there is Townshend,<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> a silent,
proud, surly, wrong-headed booby; there is my
Lord North,<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> a very good poor creature, but a
very weak man; there is my Lord Baltimore, who
thinks he understands everything and understands
nothing, who wants to be well with both Courts and
is well at neither, and <i lang="fr">entre nous</i> is a little mad,
and who else of his servants can you name that he
listens to, unless it is the stuttering puppy, Johnny
Lumley?”<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>The ejection of the Prince and his family from
St. James’s Palace had not been viewed without
remonstrance; the Duke of Newcastle had begged
the Princess Emily “for God’s sake”; that she
would use her influence with her mother to prevent
the last message going to the Prince.</p>

<p>But this request being conveyed to the Queen, by
the Princess, did the Duke more harm with her than
“all the stories his enemies could put together.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span></p>

<p>So the message went, and the Prince and his
family had to turn out on the 14th of September.</p>

<p>But even in this turning out, the little King, with
his million a year<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> income, could not behave like a
gentleman.</p>

<p>Not only were all foreign Ambassadors notified
that it would be agreeable to the King if they kept
away from the Prince’s house, but a written message
was sent round to all peers, peeresses and privy
councillors, stating that whoever waited on the
Prince by way of attending his levées should not be
received at Court.</p>

<p>The Guard was taken away from the Prince’s
house, and, meanest of all, when Sir Robert Walpole,
prompted by the Dukes of Newcastle and
Grafton, tried to persuade the King and Queen
to give the Prince and his wife the furniture of
their apartments, the very reasonable request was
refused.</p>

<p>The excuse the King made was that he had given
the Prince Five thousand pounds out of his own
pocket when he married to “set out” with, and,
in addition, he had his wife’s fortune, another
Five thousand pounds. (It does not seem clear,
however, what this had to do with the King.)</p>

<p>“The wedding of the Prince of Wales,” the King
added, “had cost him, one way and another, Fifty
thousand pounds, and therefore he positively
declined to let his son and his wife take any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
of their furniture away from their apartments,
and he instructed the Lord Chamberlain, the Duke
of Grafton, to see that none was removed.”</p>

<p>Lord Hervey, who was standing by at the time
these orders were given, appears to have remonstrated
and to have pointed out that chests and
things of that nature could not be regarded as
furniture, but were conveniences in which to pack
the Prince and Princess’s clothes, otherwise they
would have to carry them away in baskets like
dirty linen.</p>

<p>“Why not?” broke in the large-minded little
King, “a basket is good enough for them.”</p>

<p>Which was a piece of meanness, which would have
disgraced a cobbler. The Queen seems to have
aided and abetted the King in this mean conduct.</p>

<p>But the Prince and Princess with their Household
and the baby, went their way, and in the
first place took up their quarters at Kew, the Prince
had despatched messengers to the heads of his
party, the “Patriots.” Lord Chesterfield was ill
of a fever at the time, and Pulteney was shooting in
Norfolk; but there appears to have been a meeting of
these two eventually with Carteret at Kew, and
all three plainly told the Prince that they considered
he had made a false step, and that his best course
would be to endeavour to patch up a peace with his
father and mother, and this he appears to have
earnestly tried to do as the two following letters
will show.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span></p>

<p>Copy of a letter from Lord Baltimore to Lord
Grantham.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
“London, September 13th, 1737.<br>
</p>

<p>“My Lord,</p>

<p>“I have in my hands a letter from his Royal
Highness to the Queen, which I am commanded
to give or transmit to your Lordship; and as I am
afraid it might be improper for me to wait upon you
at Hampton Court, I must beg you will be so good
as to let me know how and in what manner I may
deliver or send it to you.</p>

<p>“If I may presume to judge of my Royal Master’s
sentiments, he does not conceive himself precluded
by the King’s message from taking this, the only
means of endeavouring as far as he is able to remove
his Majesty’s displeasure.</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 15.5em;">“I am,</span><br>
“Your Lordship’s very humble Servant,<br>
<span style="margin-right: 8em;">“<span class="smcap">Baltimore</span>.”</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p>This letter caused a considerable flutter at
Hampton Court, and a consultation was held as to
what was to be done. It was said the Queen was
anxious to refuse her son’s letter, but Sir Robert
Walpole finished the matter by forbidding her to
receive it, or to become mediatrix between the Prince
and his father, in which there is no doubt he was simply
doing the Queen’s will and taking the blame on his
own shoulders.</p>

<p>The following letter was sent in reply to Lord
Baltimore’s, and was dictated to Lord Grantham<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
by Sir Robert Walpole. The Queen was on this
occasion most anxious that Lord Grantham, who
was a notoriously bad writer, should be carefully
watched lest he made mistakes, and she was most
desirous that the Prince should quite understand
her intentions. This is the letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
“Lord Grantham to Lord Baltimore.<br>
<span style="margin-right: 9em;">“Hampton Court.</span><br>
<span style="margin-right: 7.5em;">“Sept. 15th, 1737.</span><br>
</p>

<p>“My Lord,</p>

<p>“I have laid your Lordship’s letter before the
Queen, who has commanded me to return your
Lordship the following answer:—</p>

<p>“‘The Queen is very sorry that the Prince’s
behaviour has given the King such just cause of
offence, but thinks herself restrained by the King’s
last message to the Prince from receiving any application
from the Prince on that subject.’</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">“I am, my Lord,</span><br>
“Your Lordship’s, etc.,<br>
<span style="margin-right: 1.5em;">“<span class="smcap">Grantham</span>.”</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p>So thus ended the Prince’s further attempt at
reconciliation by means of his mother.</p>

<p>He was, however, soon busy in finding a town
house for himself and his family, whilst Carlton
House—which stood near where the Duke of York’s
Column now is—was being decorated and altered.</p>

<p>Carlton House had been purchased by him in
1732, through Lord Chesterfield, from the Countess
of Burlington.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span></p>

<p>The house derived its name from Henry Boyle,
Lord Carlton who probably built it, and who dying
unmarried in 1725, it passed to his nephew, Lord
Burlington, who gave it to his mother, from whom
the Prince bought it. The Prince must at this time
have had some idea of making a home for himself,
and again in 1735 when he altered and much
enlarged it.</p>

<p>But while Carlton House was being repaired he
looked around for a temporary residence, and at first
thought of Southampton House, which stood in a
court and garden between what are now Bloomsbury
and Russell Squares: the site is at the present
time covered with houses. This residence was
refused him by the owner, the Duke of Bedford, who
was afraid to offend the King and Queen.</p>

<p>He then turned his attention to Norfolk House in
St. James’s Square, but here again the owner, the
Duke of Norfolk, had fears of getting into hot water,
and sent the Duchess to Hampton Court to interview
the Queen on the subject.</p>

<p>Finding there were no difficulties in the way, the
Duke of Norfolk placed his house at the Prince’s
disposal, and the latter shortly moved into it with
his family. It may here be mentioned that it was
in Norfolk House, in an old very ordinary looking
bed with green hangings, that George the Third of
England was born on the 4th June following, less
than eleven months after the birth of his sister.</p>

<p>At Norfolk House the Prince, though he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
materially reduced his expenses and “farmed his
tables”—<i>i.e.</i>, was catered for at so much a head—yet
soon gathered around him a Court, small,
but brilliant. The Prince’s wit and great amiability,
and the beauty and youth of his Princess,
very naturally formed an attraction to many, and
those principally of the most refined circle of the
aristocracy, and their followers, the men of letters.</p>

<p>The King had previously expressed his opinion of
his son’s supporters when they had gathered round
him at Kew after his expulsion, and had added in
anger and some jealousy: “They will soon be tired
of the puppy.”</p>

<p>But still the Prince drew around him all the
rising young men of the Tory Party and many of
the wits of the day.</p>

<p>Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, thus speaks of
him at this time:—</p>

<p>“There is a great deal of very good company goes
to Norfolk House, but if I were to advise, I would
have more play, to make more people easy by sitting
down, as it used to be in all the Courts, that ever I
knew, either by a basset-table, or at other games,
letting people of quality go halves. But they
begin, to my thinking, with the same forms the late
Queen did, only to leave room to entertain a few of
the town ladies, and I think it don’t lessen one’s
greatness, but the contrary, to make everybody, one
can, easy.”</p>

<p>There was an incident one night at a theatre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
which caused the King and Queen much chagrin.</p>

<p>The play was “Cato,” and the Prince of Wales
and his party were present; and the lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“When vice prevails, and impious men bear sway,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The post of honour is a private station.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The audience, noting the application, broke out into
cheers for the Prince, which he suitably acknowledged
and joined in the applause for the actor.</p>

<p>But the most exasperating incident for the King
and Queen was when the Prince and Princess of
Wales received their good friends the Lord Mayor
and Aldermen of London at Carlton House, to which
mansion they went for the occasion.</p>

<p>The Lord Mayor and Aldermen had, very soon
after the birth of the Princess, expressed a hope to
the Prince that he would receive them to express
their congratulations, and the Prince had characteristically
replied that as soon as the Princess was
well enough, he would communicate a date to them,
when they could both receive them. The date
eventually fixed upon was Thursday, the 22nd
September, and the place Carlton House, the Duke
of Norfolk’s house probably not being sufficiently
large to contain such a deputation.</p>

<p>The Prince and Princess were attended on this
occasion by Lord Carteret, Lord Chesterfield, the
Duke of Marlborough and many others of the
Household and Council.</p>

<p><em>To every member of the City deputation</em> was
given a printed copy of the King’s last message to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
his son—that originally written by Lord Hervey—turning
the Prince and his family out of St. James’s.</p>

<p>The noblemen and gentlemen standing by the
Prince, added their comments to the copies of the
letter, especially Lord Carteret.</p>

<p>“You see, gentlemen,” he said, “how the Prince
is threatened if he does not dismiss us; but we are
here still for all that. He is a rock. You may
depend upon him, gentlemen. He is sincere. He
is firm.”</p>

<p>The Prince was a wordy man, and perhaps more
beloved by the City on that account. The citizens
had come out to enjoy themselves, and would have
gone away disappointed if the Prince had not addressed
them at length; besides it was an honour
thus to be taken into his confidence over such a
private affair.</p>

<p>The Prince did not disappoint them as regards the
speech. He explained his great interest in the
affairs of the City of London, and gave them a great
idea of their importance, which was very acceptable
to the Lord Mayor and Aldermen. He claimed
their friendship, and told them he should never look
upon them as <em>beggars</em>.</p>

<p>This last was a terrible blow at Sir Robert
Walpole, who in the Excise year had given the
greatest offence to the City of London by having
been reported to have said “that the citizens were
a party of sturdy beggars.”</p>

<p>Even Sir Robert Walpole was angered when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
report of these proceedings reached the Court. The
condition of the irate little King and his Queen can
best be imagined.</p>

<p>“The Prince is firm, he is a rock,” sneered Sir
Robert, “the Prince can never be more firm in
maintaining Carteret than I am in my resolution
never to have anything to do with him. <em>I am a
rock</em>,” he raved, “I am determined in no shape will
I ever act with <em>that</em> man.”</p>

<p>But there appeared to be a considerable mystery
about the printing of the King’s letter of expulsion,
as Lord Hervey states that Sir Robert Walpole had
told him fully a week before that he intended to let
this message “slip into print.” So that it is possible
that Lord Carteret was only carrying out his
intentions—for it was Carteret who had the letter
printed—but not quite in the way which he intended
or wished. About this time there was an amusing
little passage between the Princess Caroline and her
brother, the Prince of Wales. The two had never
been friends.</p>

<p>It was by way of a message delivered by the
Princess through the medium of Monsieur Desnoyer,
that ubiquitous and much favoured dancing-master,
who is continually hopping in and out of the history
of this period.</p>

<p>The Princess instructed Desnoyer that when the
Prince, who kept the dancing-master in his household,
asked what they were saying about him at
Hampton Court, concerning his adventure on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
night of his daughter’s birth, Desnoyer was to reply
that the Princess Caroline declared that all of them,
excepting the Princess, deserved to be hanged.</p>

<p>“I know,” concluded the Princess, “you would
tell this again, Monsieur Desnoyer, though I did not
give you leave; but I say it with no other design
than that you should repeat it.” Monsieur Desnoyer
bowed and departed; but the next time he came to
give his dancing lesson at Hampton Court the
Princess Caroline hastened to ask him like a woman,
full of curiosity, if he had delivered her message to
the Prince of Wales.</p>

<p>“Yes, Madame,” responded the man of figures.</p>

<p>“And in the same words?” demanded the Princess.</p>

<p>“Yes, Madame, I have said: Monseigneur, do you
know what Madame la Princesse Caroline has
charged me to tell you? She said, Monseigneur,
saving the respect that I bear you, that your Royal
Highness ought to be hanged.”</p>

<p>“And what did he answer?” gasped the Princess,
in an agony of expectation.</p>

<p>“Madame,” replied the dancing-master, “he spat
in the fire, and then presently replied. ‘Ah! you
know what Caroline is, she is always like that.’”</p>

<p>“When you see him again,” replied the Princess,
bridling, “tell him that his answer is as foolish as
his conduct.”</p>

<p>Just like a loving brother and sister!</p>

<p>Thus writes Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, of
events at this time, 1737:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span></p>

<p>“They have printed all the letters and messages
that have passed between the King, Queen, Prince
and Princess. This shows that the Minister thinks
he has been in the right; but I don’t find any
reasonable body of that opinion. And I observe
that they have left out in this printed paper a
message from his Majesty to the Prince, which was
brought in writing by my Lord Dunmore; in which
they judged very well, for it was certainly a very
odd one, as I think it is, my Lord Harrington’s and
Sir Robert Walpole’s evidence concerning the
Prince, some part of which is certainly untrue.</p>

<p>“But upon the whole matter nobody can think
that the Prince designed to hurt the Princess or the
child, which was of much more consequence to him
than it can be to her Majesty, who has so many
children of her own. If the Prince had not had good
success in what he ventured to do; and if it had
been a real crime, the submissions the Prince has
made, one would think ought to have been accepted,
for the omission of a ceremony that was not natural
for the Prince to think of at the time; and especially
as he was treated at Court. But I suppose that Sir
Robert did not think it a proper thing to say that
the true cause of the quarrel was the Prince’s
seeming to have a desire to have the whole of the
allowance which the public pays for his support;
and, indeed, I do think it would not have been
becoming to have given that reason for what has
been done. But if I may presume to give my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
opinion against Sir Robert’s, I should rather in his
place have chose to have sent the message to the
Prince, that he must leave St. James’s, because the
King was dissatisfied with his behaviour in general;
and not have given such strange reasons for the
quarrel, and then publish a printed account with so
many reflections upon the Prince, which no man that
has any notion of honour can ever forgive.”</p>

<p>With regard to the publication of these letters,
which was a kind of set-off against the Prince’s
address to the Lord Mayor, Lord Hervey was
employed to translate the Prince’s, and in the midst
of his task went off to London. On his return he
was greeted by the Queen, who was most anxious
about the letters, in the following terms:—</p>

<p>“Where the devil are you, and what have you
been doing? You are a pretty man to have the
justification of your friends committed to your
hands! There are the letters which you have had
this week to translate, and they are not yet ready to
be dispersed, and only that you must go to London
to divert yourself with some of your nasty <i lang="fr">guenipes</i><a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
instead of doing what you have undertaken.”</p>

<p>Hervey made her a quotation from Shakespeare
in reply:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Go tell your slaves how choleric you are, and
make your bondmen tremble. Your anger passes
by me like the idle wind which I regard not.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.<br><span class="small"><span class="smcap">The Death of the Queen.</span></span></h2></div>


<p>But now over the squabblings and disagreements
of this Royal Family, with their enormous wealth
and power, was gathering a dark cloud from which
presently descended a greater Power than theirs,
the Power which one day touches all, and which the
riches of a Palace are as impotent to resist as the
poverty of a poor man’s dwelling—the Power of
Death.</p>

<p>For some time past the Queen’s health had been
steadily failing; possibly the excitement of the last
few months, Madame de Walmoden, the King’s
danger in the storm, the affair of the Prince’s
income, and lastly the <i lang="fr">émeute</i> at the birth of his
child, had been all too much for her, yet her death
as will be seen was mainly the result of her own
fault, the foolish concealment of a malady.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the 9th of November, 1737, the
Queen was taken ill while superintending the
arrangements of her new library attached to St.
James’s Palace—the library is now pulled down.
She described her complaint as the cholic and
suffered great pain, Doctor Tesier, the German
Physician to the Household, gave her some of a
concoction called “Daffy’s Elixir,” and ordered her
to bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, that being a Drawing Room day,
and fearing to disappoint the King, and the company,
she rose, dressed and attended the function.</p>

<p>Lord Hervey describes the following conversation
with her when he entered the rooms:</p>

<p>“Is it not intolerable,” she said, “at my age to be
plagued with a new distemper? Here is that nasty
cholic I had at Hampton Court come again.”</p>

<p>She looked extremely ill, and telling him the
incidents of the morning Lord Hervey became
alarmed.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, Madam,” he said, “go to your
room, what have you to do here?”</p>

<p>She went and talked a little to the people and
then came back again to Hervey.</p>

<p>“I am not able to entertain people,” she said.</p>

<p>“Would to God,” he replied, impatiently, “the
King would have done talking of the ‘Dragon of
Wantley,’ and release you!”</p>

<p>This was a new silly farce, which no doubt just
suited the King who was for ever talking about it.
It was a burlesque on the Italian Opera, by Henry
Carey, and first played at Covent Garden the 26th
October, 1737.</p>

<p>At last the King had said his last word on this
entertaining subject and left, giving the Queen the
chance which both she and Lord Hervey desired, for
her to get away.</p>


<p class="center p2"><span class="figcenter"  id="img012">

</span></p>
<p class="center caption">CAROLINE, QUEEN OF GEORGE II, AND THE YOUNG
DUKE OF CUMBERLAND</p>


<p>The King, however, as he passed her, reminded
her that she had not spoken to the Duchess of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
Norfolk, and she went back and said a few words to
her. This was the last person she ever spoke to in
public. She retired, went at once to bed, and grew
steadily worse.</p>

<p>The King, however, was not at all alarmed, indeed
his courageous wife did all she could to reassure him,
and he went off in the evening to play cards with
Lady Deloraine. When, however, he returned late,
the condition of the Queen so alarmed him that he
sent off for another physician, Doctor Broxholme,
Ranby, the King’s house surgeon, being already
there, principally for bleeding purposes apparently.</p>

<p>These learned doctors, who all along regarded her
symptoms as those of cholic, could think of nothing
better to give her than usquebaugh, <i>i.e.</i>, whiskey—which
seemed to do her as much good as the many
nostrums which were afterwards administered.
Having tried such things as Daffy’s Elixir, mint
water, usquebaugh, snake root, and “Sir Walter
Raleigh’s Cordial”—which appears to have been
some remedy of the great explorer’s which had
survived to that time—the doctors, in the fashion of
the day, decided to bleed the Queen, and the ever-ready
Ranby was ordered to draw off twelve ounces
of blood.</p>

<p>The King, now thoroughly alarmed, commenced
to show great anxiety, and insisted on lying in his
night-gown, <i>i.e.</i>, dressing gown, outside the Queen’s
bed all night, so that he greatly inconvenienced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
both her and himself, as he could not sleep, and the
poor sufferer could not turn in bed.</p>

<p>The diary of the Queen’s illness may be summarised
as follows:</p>

<p>Thursday, November 18th.</p>

<p>The Queen was bled again early in the morning,
and lost twelve ounces, which abated her fever. As
the King left her to go to his own side of the
Palace, she grew very despondent, and told her
daughter Caroline that no matter what they did she
would die. “Poor Caroline,” she added to her
daughter, who was ailing, “you are very ill, too;
we shall soon meet again in another place.”</p>

<p>Growing better in the morning the King
determined to hold a Levee, and was very particular
about having his new lace cuffs sewn on his shirt, as
the Foreign Ministers were coming. Sir Robert
Walpole was at his country seat, Houghton, in
Norfolk, and knew nothing of the Queen’s illness.
This day there was some talk of sending for him,
and the Duke of Newcastle and Lord Hervey both
wrote.</p>

<p>This evening the Queen said to her daughter
Caroline and Lord Hervey, who was with her—he
seems to have hardly left her—“I have an ill which
nobody knows of.” No particular significance was
however attached to this remark.</p>

<p>This night, two more physicians were called in,
Sir Hans Sloan, and Dr. Hulst, who, still treating
her for cholic and an internal stoppage, ordered her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
blisters and aperients; the latter, like everything
else she took, she brought up.</p>

<p>Friday, November 11th.</p>

<p>Early in the morning the Queen was again
“blooded” for fever. Her bad symptoms remained
the same. This day the Prince of Wales, hearing
of his mother’s illness, came to Carlton House in
Pall Mall from Kew, and Lord Hervey, hearing of
this, became much alarmed lest he should call at the
Palace and ask for his mother. He flew to the
King to ask for instructions—he was the only Lord
of the Court allowed near the King and Queen.
These were instructions which no doubt gladdened
the heart of Lord Hervey:</p>

<p>The King said:</p>

<p>“If the puppy should, in one of his impertinent,
affected, airs of duty and affection, dare to come to
St. James’s, I order you to go to the scoundrel and
tell him I wonder at his impudence to come here;
that he has my orders already and knows my
pleasure, and bid him to go about his business.”</p>

<p>Very fatherly conduct under the circumstances!</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards while Lord Hervey was sitting
with the Duke of Cumberland drinking tea in the
Queen’s outer apartment, Lady Pembroke approached
and informed them that Lord North had
just been there from the Prince of Wales, who had
desired her in the Prince’s name to let the King and
Queen know that his Royal Highness was greatly
distressed to hear of the Queen’s illness and had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
come to London to be near her. The only thing
which could alleviate his concern was the favour of
being allowed to see her.</p>

<p>The Duke, then seventeen, made the following
formal answer:</p>

<p>“I am not a proper person, Madam, to take the
charge of this message, but there is Lord Hervey,
who is the only one of papa’s servants that sees him
at present, and is just going to him; if you will
deliver it to him, he will certainly let the King
know.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, Lady Pembroke repeated the message
to Lord Hervey, who took it to the King.</p>

<p>“This,” raved his Majesty, when he received it,
“is like one of the scoundrel’s tricks,” and he
forthwith sent the following kind answer to his son’s
message—written at the suggestion of Lord Hervey,
and probably at his dictation also—per Lord North,
to whom Lord Hervey read it from the paper, to
prevent any of “<i>Cartouche’s Gang</i>,” as the Queen
called her son’s party, from garbling it. The
message was as follows:—</p>

<p>“I have acquainted the King with the message
sent to Lady Pembroke, and his Majesty has ordered
me to say that in the present situation and circumstances
his Majesty does not think fit that the
Prince should see the Queen, and therefore expects
that he should not come to St. James’s.”</p>

<p>This was considered far too mild by the King.</p>

<p>But the state of the Queen’s mind towards her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
son, even at this unfortunate time, may be gauged
by the following incident:</p>

<p>On this Friday afternoon she asked the King
whether “The Griff” had sent to ask to see her.
“But sooner or later,” she continued, “I am sure
we shall be plagued with some message of that kind,
because he will think it will have a good air in the
world to ask to see me; and perhaps hopes I shall
be fool enough to let him come, and give him the
pleasure to see the last breath go out of my body, by
which means he would have the joy of knowing I
was dead five minutes sooner than he could know it
in Pall Mall.”</p>

<p>Fine sentiments these, for a mother on her death
bed to hold towards her eldest son!</p>

<p>But the whole of this Friday the Queen grew
worse hour by hour. But it was on Saturday that
the true nature of her illness was discovered, and
this by a hint given to Ranby, the Court Surgeon
by the King, who then, for the first time, stated
that he believed the Queen was suffering from an
umbilical rupture, incurred at the birth of Princess
Louisa thirteen years before. Incredible as it appears,
there is not a question of a doubt but that
the Queen had concealed this rupture for all those
years simply and solely because if the knowledge of
this ailment was bruited about, it would tend to
render her objectionable to the King—though it
appears he was aware of it—and that she would
have died rather than disclose it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span></p>

<p>Her motive was plainly jealousy of his mistresses.</p>

<p>However, once the hint was given, Ranby, the
Surgeon, would not be denied, and insisted on an
examination, which she strove by every means in
her power to avoid.</p>

<p>When this had been conducted and Ranby was
whispering to the King in a corner, she started up
in bed:</p>

<p>“I am sure now, you blockhead,” she cried, “you
are telling the King I have a rupture.”</p>

<p>“I am so,” answered Ranby, “and there is no
more time to be lost, your Majesty has concealed it
too long already, and I beg another surgeon may be
called in immediately.”</p>

<p>The Queen did not answer, but, lying down,
turned her face to the wall and wept. The only
time she shed a tear, as the King stated, during her
illness.</p>

<p>As Dr. Ranby stated there was little time to be
lost; the King sent at once for Dr. Busier,<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> a
French surgeon, eighty years old, in whom they all
had great confidence, but he not being found,
Ranby was sent out to bring in the first surgeon of
note he could find. The celebrated Cheselden,
Surgeon to the Queen, appears to have been absent.</p>

<p>Ranby returned however with Shipton, an
eminent City surgeon, and shortly after, Busier, the
French surgeon, arrived, who advised an immediate
operation. This was objected to by the other two,
and thus probably the Queen’s last chance went.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span></p>
<p>The following may be taken as an example of the
hatred which had grown up in the King’s heart against
his eldest son. The ever-ready Hervey whispered
a suggestion to him on this day which enraged him.</p>

<p>He told him “that he had heard it mentioned
among some lawyers” that Richmond Gardens—the
Queen’s private estate—would go to the Prince of
Wales if his mother died.</p>

<p>So furious did the King become at this suggestion,
that he was not satisfied until the Lord
Chancellor had been fetched off the Bench to give
an opinion on it, which being against the Prince, he
communicated it to the Queen to comfort her.</p>

<p>This Saturday evening an operation of a minor
character was performed upon the Queen.</p>

<p>The next day, Sunday, the 13th, was a black day;
the Queen’s wound began to mortify and all hope
was abandoned.</p>

<p>This day she practically took leave of her
favourite son:</p>

<p>“As for you, William,” she said, “you know I
have always loved you tenderly and placed my chief
hope in you.”</p>

<p>She bade him be a support to the King, and not
go against his brother.</p>

<p>But it was on this Sunday afternoon that the
celebrated interview took place between the King
and Queen, which perhaps was the most extraordinary,
valedictory conversation between man and
wife the world has ever heard of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span></p>

<p>The Queen had been taking leave of her family;
she turned sadly to her husband and drew from her
finger a fine ruby ring he had given her at her
coronation, and gave it to him back again.</p>

<p>“This is the last thing I have to give you.” she
said. “Naked I came to you, naked I go from you.
I had everything I ever possessed from you, and to
you whatever I have I return. My will you will
find a very short one; I give all I have to you.”</p>

<p>She then very solemnly repeated to him advice
which she had often given him before; that he
should marry again.</p>

<p>The King had been sobbing before; this advice
brought on a passion of weeping, amidst which he
made this remarkable and most characteristic response:</p>

<p>“Non, j’aurai des maîtresses.”</p>

<p>One would have thought that, King as he was,
some one would have hushed him down, but the
Queen seems to have very calmly answered:</p>

<p>“Mon Dieu! cela n’empêche pas.”</p>

<p>What can one say of a man and wife who talked
thus over a death bed?</p>

<p>The Queen was thought to be dying that day,
but she lingered on. On Monday morning, Sir
Robert Walpole arrived post haste from Houghton;
he had only heard of the Queen’s illness on the
previous day owing to the Duke of Newcastle’s
neglect in sending the messenger round to the
Duke of Grafton first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span></p>

<p>All Sir Robert’s enemies seemed to have
concluded that his power would wane, when the
Queen, his patroness and friend, was dead; they
did their best to keep him from her at the last.
But he arrived long before the Queen died, and one
of his first remarks on the situation to Lord Hervey
was the following: “Oh, my Lord!” cried Sir
Robert, greatly distressed, “if this woman should
die what a scene of confusion will here be!
Who can tell into what hands the King will fall?
or who will have the management of him? I defy
the ablest person in this kingdom to foresee what
will be the consequence of this great event.”</p>

<p>There was a particularly scandalous rumour
prevalent at the Court during this sad time concerning
the Prince, which emanated, as usual, from
Lord Hervey, who said he heard it from the Duke
of Marlborough through one of his—Lord Hervey’s—particular
friends, Harry Fox.</p>

<p>The rumour was that the Prince used to sit up
half the night at Carlton House, sending messengers
continually to the Palace to make enquiries, and
eagerly awaiting his mother’s death with remarks
like the following:—</p>

<p>“Well, sure, we shall soon have good news; she
cannot hold out much longer!”</p>

<p>It may be said at once that Mr. Hamilton, one of
the Prince’s Household, contradicted these reports
immediately he heard them, and added that the
Prince was in the greatest concern for his mother,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
which seems by far the more natural and likely
state for him to be in.</p>

<p>He was irritated, there can be no doubt, and no
wonder at it; the very fact of his being excluded,
not only from his mother’s death bed, but from the
Palace itself, and every one belonging to his household
as well, was calculated to fill him with the
bitterest thoughts. The contemplation of the fact
that all her other children were <em>there</em>, and that
Lord Hervey, his bitterest enemy, was occupying
his place by his mother’s pillow, was not likely to
bring much calm to his feelings. The only wonder
is that he did not insist upon forcing himself into
her room.</p>

<p>When Lady Archibald Hamilton was consulted
as to the above rumours concerning the Prince’s
behaviour, her answer was, “he is very decent.”</p>

<p>But a question was raised—by Lord Hervey
again—about the members of the Prince’s Household
coming even to the Palace to inquire and
remain in the general ante-room in which all
inquirers waited for news. The King was at last
moved to send a message, by Lord Hervey, to Sir
Robert Walpole to ask what was to be done about
these messages from the Prince.</p>

<p>Lord Hervey, eager for an additional insult to
those the Prince had recently received, was strongly
in favour of their being excluded from the Palace.
He maintained that they were evading the King’s
order not to come into his presence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span></p>

<p>Sir Robert, however, was far too wise to interfere
with them, and sagely advised that they should be
left alone.</p>

<p>All through that Monday, and Tuesday, and
Wednesday, the Queen grew worse and worse,
until, among the people, questions were continually
being asked as to whether she had seen a clergyman.</p>

<p>The echoes of these questions reached the Palace,
and those about the Queen’s bed began to consider
what was to be done. The King in his character of
head of the church, had deputed his duties in regard
to the appointment of the Bishops to the
Queen; he took no interest in such things. Indeed
his opinion of Bishops in general, which he freely
expressed, was not a high one. He strongly
objected to their incomes, which he stated were inconsistent
with their preaching.</p>

<p>It appears therefore that the Queen, Sir Robert
Walpole—who had no religious convictions whatever—and
Mrs. Clayton—Lady Sundon—did most
of the appointing of the Spiritual Peers. The
Queen herself is described as a Protestant of very
broad views.</p>

<p>When then the question began to be canvassed
between the King, Sir Robert Walpole, and Lord
Hervey as to what was to be done to provide the
Queen with a spiritual adviser to see her comfortably
out of the world, neither seemed very well
prepared to give an opinion on the point, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
all three clearly saw that something must be done
to satisfy public opinion and prejudice.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Walpole, however, summed up the
matter in the following directions to Princess
Amelia:—</p>

<p>“Pray, Madam, let this farce be played: the
Archbishop will act it very well. You may bid
him be as short as you will. It will do the
Queen no hurt, no more than any good; and it
will satisfy all the wise and good fools, who will
call us all atheists if we don’t pretend to be as great
fools as they are.”</p>

<p>So much for Sir Robert’s opinion of the consolations
of religion. As for the King, he never
waited to see Archbishop Potter, the Primate, but
fled hastily from the Queen’s chamber when he
heard he was approaching. The observances for
which the Bishop was responsible, conveyed nothing
to his mind whatever. Potter attended the Queen,
night and morning after this Wednesday, but what
passed between them is not known.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of inquiry as to whether
the Queen would receive the sacrament, “some
fools,” according to Lord Hervey, “said the Queen
had not religion enough to ask to receive the
sacrament.”</p>

<p>The Archbishop maintained a discreet silence on
the point, when asked as he came from the sick
chamber:</p>

<p>“Has the Queen received?” he parried the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
question by replying: “Gentlemen, Her Majesty is
in a most heavenly frame of mind.”</p>

<p>But that the visit of the Archbishop had resulted
in any reconciliation between the Queen and the
Prince of Wales, there is not a trace of evidence,
indeed the testimony is all the other way. She
could not bear at this time to think that even the
gentlemen of his household were in her ante-room,
and at last had it cleared of all strangers.</p>

<p>“Will nobody turn these ravens out of the
house!” she cried, “who are only there to watch
my death, and would gladly tear me to pieces
whilst I am alive!”</p>

<p>No, there was, unhappily, no forgiveness nor wish
for reconciliation there.</p>

<p>Thursday, Friday, Saturday passed in much the
same way as the preceding sad days except that the
Queen grew steadily weaker. The King distinguished
himself by a mixture of brutality and
tenderness towards the dying woman. He scarcely
ever left her room, night or day, except when the
Archbishop came to offer spiritual consolation.</p>

<p>“How the devil should you sleep when you will
never lie still a moment!” he exclaimed on one
occasion, when her continual shifting in bed, owing
to her ailment and her wound, worried him. But
he was equally annoyed when she would lie quite
still; looking straight before her as sick persons
will at nothing: “<i lang="fr">Mon Dieu!</i>” he exclaimed
irritably, exasperated at her quietness. “What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
are you looking at? What makes you fix your
eyes like that? Your eyes look like a calf’s when
it is going to have its throat cut!”</p>

<p>All this, of course, was very suitable to the
decorum of the death-bed of a Queen, but perhaps
after all the little man was worn out with the
continuous watching.</p>

<p>Then came Sunday, and each hour the Queen
grew weaker, so that it came to be a wonder that she
had survived the last; but she lingered on until
the evening, and then asked Dr. Tesier, her
physician:</p>

<p>“How long can this last?”</p>

<p>“I think,” he replied, “that your Majesty will
soon be relieved from suffering.”</p>

<p>“The sooner the better,” she answered.</p>

<p>Lord Hervey thus describes the last scene:</p>

<p>“About ten o’clock on Sunday night—the King
being in bed and asleep on the floor at the foot
of the Queen’s bed, and the Princess Emily in a
couch-bed in a corner of the room—the Queen
began to rattle in her throat; and Mrs. Purcel,
giving the alarm that she was expiring, all in
the room started up, Princess Caroline was sent
for and Lord Hervey, but before the last arrived
the Queen was just dead. All she said before she
died was:</p>

<p>“I have now got an asthma. Open the window.”
Then she added:</p>

<p>“<em>Pray.</em>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span></p>

<p>Upon which the Princess Emily began to read
some prayers, of which she scarcely repeated ten
words when the Queen expired. The Princess
Caroline held a looking-glass to her lips, and,
finding there was not the least damp upon it,
cried: “’Tis over!”</p>

<p>The King kissed the face and hands of the lifeless
body several times, but in a few minutes left
the Queen’s apartment.</p>

<p>Thus died Caroline, by some called “The Illustrious,”
by some even “The Great,” but whose
character was such a mixture of great and little
things that it is most difficult to give an accurate
estimate of its virtues or vices.</p>

<p>That she began well as a young girl cannot be
doubted; she was beautiful and brilliant, and
entered life with the very best intentions. Indeed,
not one word has ever been said against her character
as a wife.</p>

<p>Perhaps the very greatest misfortune which ever
happened to her was to have married George Augustus,
Electorial Prince of Hanover, and therefore in
due course to have become Queen of England.</p>

<p>Perhaps as the consort of the Prince of some petty
German State she might have shone as a wife
and mother, and brought up her children with
good honest affection.</p>

<p>As it was, she early fell under the influence of
such men as Sir Robert Walpole—soulless, godless.
No, not godless, because their God was Ambition,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
before which no sacrifice was too great, Honour,
Truth, or even the lives of men.</p>

<p>Surely poor Caroline must have fallen far, when
she adopted as her constant companion, such a man
as Lord Hervey.</p>

<p>But whatever good there was in her—and there
was much—seems to have been choked and hidden
by her greed for Power, which even led her to
pander to her little contemptible husband’s vices.</p>

<p>Her conduct to her eldest son was without excuse,
unless her separation of fourteen years from him can
be regarded in that light; but it is much more
likely that the arrival of the handsome boy,
Prince William, had more to do with her forgetfulness.</p>

<p>Unhappily, there is very little doubt that she
died unreconciled to Frederick, and that moreover
she desired no reconciliation. Had there been any
such reconciliation, it would have been made public
at the time when such verses as the following were
floating about.</p>

<p>Lord Chesterfield wrote an epitaph to the Queen
in these words:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Here lies unpitied both by Church and State,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The subject of their flattery and hate;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Flattered by those on whom her favours flow’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hated for favours impiously bestow’d;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who aimed the Church by Churchmen to betray,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And hoped to share in arbitrary sway.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In Tindal’s and in Hoadley’s path she trod,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An hypocrite in all but disbelief in God.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Promoted Luxury, encouraged vice—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Herself a sordid slave to avarice.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">True friendship’s love ne’er touched her heart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Falsehood appeared in vice disguised by art</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fawning and haughty; when familiar, rude</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And never civil, seem’d but to delude.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Inquisitive in trifling, mean affairs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Heedless of public good or orphan’s tears.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>To her own offspring mercy she denied</i>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, unforgiving, unforgiven, died.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The above bitter lines, in exceedingly bad taste,
are only valuable as regards the two last, which
clearly state—and Lord Chesterfield was in a
position to know—that she did not forgive her
son at the last.</p>

<p>Pope, too, who seems, like the majority, to have
been on the side of the Prince, concludes another
poem on the subject in the following ironical
words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Hang the sad verse on Carolina’s urn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And hail her passage to the realms of rest.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All parts performed <i>and all her children blest</i>.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>These are sage Sarah of Marlborough’s reflexions,
none too charitable, on the Queen’s death:</p>

<p>“1737. Our Bishops are now about to employ
hands to write the finest character that ever was
heard of—Queen Caroline; who, as it is no treason,
I freely own that I am glad she is dead. For to get
money, that has proved of no manner of use to her,
and to support Sir Robert in all his arbitrary
injustice, she brought this nation on the very
brink of ruin, and has endangered the succession
of her own family, by raising so high a dissatisfaction
in the whole nation, as there is to them all, and by
giving so much power to France, whenever they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
think fit to make use of it, who will have no mercy
upon England.</p>

<p>“1737. His Majesty thinks he has lost the
greatest politician that ever was born, and one
that did him the greatest service that was possible.
Though everybody else that knows the truth must
acknowledge that it was quite the contrary. For
my own part it is demonstration to me, that nothing
could have put this nation and family in danger but
the measures of the Queen and Sir Robert. To my
knowledge, most of the weeping ladies that went to
the King, have expressed the same opinion of the
Queen formerly that I have described.</p>

<p>“1737-8. Upon her great understanding and
goodness there comes out nauseous panegyrics every
day, that make one sick, so full of nonsense and
lies, that there is one very remarkable from a
Dr. Clarke, in order to have the first bishoprick that
falls, and I daresay he will have it, though there is
something extremely ridiculous in the panegyric;
for after he has given her the most perfect character
that ever any woman had or can have, he allows
that:</p>

<p>“‘She had sacrificed her reputation to the great
and the many, to show her duty to the King, and
her love to her country.’ These are the clergyman’s
words exactly, which allows she did wrong
things, but it was to please the King; which is
condemning him. I suppose he must mean some
good she did to her own country, for I know of none<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
she did in England, unless raking from the public
deserves a panegyric.</p>

<p>“1737-8. It seems to me as if her ghost did everything
by their saying, whatever is to be done, was
the Queen’s opinion should be so; and everything is
compassed by that means by Sir Robert, without
any trouble at all; but if ——<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> should happen to
have an opinion of any person that is living,
perhaps they may get the better of the ghost.”</p>

<p>Caroline was buried with great pomp in a new
vault in Henry the Seventh’s Chapel, in Westminster
Abbey, on Saturday, the 17th of December,
1737. By her side when his time came was also
laid George the Second. An interesting incident in
this connection was related to the Right Honourable
J. Wilson, compiler of “Hervey’s Memoirs,” by a
Mr. Milman, Prebendary of Westminster.</p>

<p>“George the Second, as the last proof of his
attachment,” he said, “gave directions that his
remains and those of Queen Caroline should be
mingled together. Accordingly the two coffins were
placed in a large stone sarcophagus, and one side of
each of the wooden coffins withdrawn. This was a
tradition at Westminster Abbey, of which I myself
have seen the confirmation, in my opinion conclusive;
and as the Royal vault in Westminster Abbey
may never be again opened, it may be curious to
preserve the record.</p>

<p>“On the occasion of the removal, in 1837, of a
stillborn child of the Duke of Cumberland (King of
Hanover) to Windsor, a Secretary of State’s
Warrant (which is necessary) arrived empowering
the Dean and Chapter to open the vault. I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
requested by the Dean to superintend the business,
which took place by night.</p>

<p>“In the middle of the vault, towards the farther
end, stands the large stone sarcophagus, and against
the wall <em>are still standing the two sides of the
coffins which were withdrawn</em>. I saw and examined
them closely, and have no doubt of the fact. The
vault contains only the family of George the Second.”
<i>H. H. Milman.</i></p>

<p>The King seems to have shown the utmost grief
for his wife, and at first to a great extent to have
secluded himself. A weird incident in connection
with this period is related by Wentworth in a letter
to Lord Strafford after the Queen’s funeral.</p>

<p>“Saturday night, between one and two o’clock,
the King waked out of a dream, very uneasy, and
ordered the vault, where the Queen is, to be broken
open immediately, and have the coffin also opened;
and went in a hackney chair through the Horse
Guards to Westminster Abbey and back again to
bed. I think it is the strangest thing that could be.”</p>

<p>He speaks of it again in another letter.</p>

<p>“The story about the King was true, for Mr.
Wallop heard of one who saw him go through the
Horse Guards on Saturday night, with ten footmen
before the chair. They went afterwards to Westminster
Abbey.”</p>

<p>There is no doubt whatever from the above
account that the King was suffering from that
awful visitation which comes so often to persons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
who have recently lost a dear one by death; the
terrible fear that the beloved <em>has been buried alive</em>.
Only those who have been victims to this haunting
fear—which is far more common than is imagined—can
give an adequate description of its terrors.</p>

<p>Morbid as the thought is, the outcome no doubt
of an exhausted nervous system, where deep grief
has followed perhaps the wearing anxiety of
watching a long illness, still it is not by any means
restricted to those of an imaginative tendency, but
comes to all temperaments alike. It would be
perhaps quite safe to say that this was what made
King George undertake his midnight journey, and
give the order for the opening of the Queen’s tomb.</p>

<p>But deep as his sorrow was for his wife, it did not
keep him from his old ways. In a very short time
Walmoden was brought over, and pending her
arrival Lady Deloraine acted the part of understudy.
“People must wear old gloves until they can get
new ones,” was Sir Robert Walpole’s comment <em>to the
Princesses</em> on this arrangement, to which he had not
only given his hearty approval, but as far as
Madame Walmoden was concerned, strongly urged
upon the King, as a duty he owed to his people to
save his health breaking down under his grief, to
bring her over.</p>

<p>To Lord Hervey Sir Robert expressed himself
more fully on this subject. “I’ll bring Madame
Walmoden over,” he said, “and I’ll have nothing to
do with your girls,” <i>i.e.</i>, the Princesses. “I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
for the wife against the mistress, but I’ll be for the
mistress against the daughters.”</p>

<p>It is needless to say that after this remark Lord
Hervey and Sir Robert Walpole fell out.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Prince of Wales appears to have
remained in his position of ostracism, and apparently
took no part in his mother’s funeral ceremonies.
The Princess Amelia acted as chief mourner, and the
King did not appear at all.</p>

<p>With the Princess, Frederick seems to have lived
at Norfolk House very comfortably, coming over to
Carlton House for any occasion of ceremony.</p>

<p>The popularity of the Prince seemed to grow, as
he lost favour with his father, and it is not at all to
be wondered at, as he possessed a natural geniality
which endeared him to all. A story is related of
him in connection with a Lord Mayor’s Show, which
is very typical.</p>

<p>Waiting to see the pageant—which was the
occasion probably which occurred during the year of
mourning—the Prince of Wales went among the
crowd in Cheapside to see the procession return to
the Guildhall. Being recognised by some members
of the Saddlers’ Company, he was invited into their
stand hard by, and there made himself so agreeable
that he was, there and then, elected their Master
for the year; an honour which he accepted with
much pleasure.</p>

<p>This period of mourning was, however, after a
time relieved of much of its tristness as far as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
King was concerned, by the lively society of his
mistresses, with whom the Princesses appeared to
have associated in perfect harmony.</p>

<p>One night at Kensington Palace, just as Lady
Deloraine was about to sit down to cards with the
King, one of the Princesses pulled her chair away
and she came down with a bump on the floor.</p>

<p>It was bad enough to be laughed at by the
Princesses, but far worse to have little George
guffawing at her with the knowledge in her mind
that she was only playing second fiddle to the
Walmoden.</p>

<p>Lady Deloraine waited her opportunity, and later,
when the King was about to sit down, pulled <em>his</em>
chair away, with the view of getting her own back
again. The result, however, was not at all what
she expected; the sacred person of his Majesty is
said to have been much bruised, and so far from
regarding the performance as a joke, he excluded
Lady Deloraine from his Court from that time forth,
and the Walmoden, now created Countess of Yarmouth,
reigned henceforth supreme till the King’s
death many years after. Many will recollect a
similar anecdote in similar circumstances in our own
day.</p>

<p>The next event, however, in the life of the Prince
of Wales, following quickly on the death of his
mother, was the birth of his eldest son, afterwards
to fill the throne of England as George the Third.
This took place at Norfolk House, St. James’s, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
the 4th of June (new style), 1738, while Carlton
House was still under repair.</p>

<p>The birth was premature, and the child very frail,
so much so that he was baptized on the day of his
birth.</p>

<p>The Poet Laureate seized this opportunity of the
birth of a Prince in the direct line of succession to
the throne to become drivelling. He congratulated
Nature that she had first amused herself by sketching
a girl—Princess Augusta—by which bit of
practice she had enabled herself to produce the
wonderful baby George!</p>

<p>Truly this Laureate was a person of some imagination!</p>

<p>The Corporation of London appear to have gone
to the King direct and in a talented address pointed
out to him the fact—which perhaps otherwise might
have been overlooked—that this joyful occasion was
the result of the alliance of the baby’s parents!</p>

<p>The Bath Municipality seem to have also done
something in this way to distinguish themselves, by
congratulating the Prince of Wales on his own
birth, to which they owed the sight of the royal
presence in which they stood.</p>

<p>It may be mentioned here that on his first birthday
little Prince George was the object of a curious
attention.</p>

<p>Sixty of the children of the aristocracy, dressed as
little soldiers with drums beating and colours flying,
entered the Palace and “elected their little Prince<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
as their Colonel.” This important event concluded,
they kissed the baby’s hand and departed.</p>

<p>The Prince and his wife—to whom he was devoted—seem
to have had a variety of residences.
Norfolk House, Leicester House—formerly the
residence of his father when Prince of Wales—situated
in Leicester Square on a site very near
where the Empire Theatre now stands; Carlton
House in Pall Mall, a house at Kew, and a Palace
at Cliefden, built by Villiers, situated on a terrace
overlooking the River Thames.</p>

<p>Here at this latter house the Prince seems to
have lived the life of a country squire, and a lover
of the river. He distributed prizes at rowing
matches, and mixed freely with the people of the
part. His dignity did not prevent him stopping to
chat with a labourer at his cottage door, or even to
enter in, and do what few Princes would condescend
to do, sit down and share the cottager’s plain meal
with him.</p>

<p>He would play cricket on the lawn at Cliefden
with his children, when they were old enough, or
stroll along the banks of the river of which he was
very fond, and his companions were not always of
the exalted order one would expect.</p>

<p>He was devoted to art, and loved talent wherever
he found it.</p>

<p>“Lord Sir,” exclaimed a simple country servant
to his master one day at Maidenhead, “I have
seen the Prince of Wales accompanied by his nobles.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span></p>

<p>The “nobles” in question were two Scottish
authors, Thompson and Mallett, neither of them
distinguished by the neatness of their attire.</p>

<p>It was alas! on the lawn at Cliefden, that
Frederick received a blow, some say from a cricket
ball, others while at a game of tennis, which was the
indirect cause of his death some years after.</p>

<p>Here at Cliefden, and at his other residences,
were to be seen his boon companions; the Earl of
Chesterfield, courtier, politician, satirist and mimic.
Lady Huntingdon, who left his world for Whitfield’s,
and whose name may be seen in almost every
town in England on Dissenting Chapels to the
present day; Bathurst, Queensberry, the clever
Pulteney, Cobham, Pitt, the Granvilles, Lyttleton,
the prig Bubb Doddington, whose one aim in life
was to be a lord. There were the two Hedges—(Charles,
who wrote epigrams)—erratic Lord Baltimore
and peevish Lord Carnarvon, Townshend, whom
George the Second much objected to, and his wife
as well—the Townshends seem to have been very
staunch to the Prince—chatty Lord North, the Earl
of Middlesex, who allowed his wife’s name to be
coupled with the Prince’s, although the lady’s
descriptions “short and dark, like a winter’s day,”
and “as yellow as a November’s morning,” were
hardly those to fascinate an artistic nature such as
Frederick’s. Yet she certainly took part in the
“Judgment of Paris” in 1745 as one of the Graces.
Last of all to be mentioned, there was that “stuttering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
puppy,” as George the Second called him,
Johnny Lumley, brother of the Earl of Scarborough.</p>

<p>The maids of honour in attendance on the Princess
of Wales, however, must have been very different to
that charming trio, “the Swiss,” “Belladine,” and
the “Schatz,” who waited upon Queen Caroline
when Princess of Wales.</p>

<p>They do not appear to have been popular in the
Prince’s household at any rate, for his head coachman
made a most curious will concerning them, in
which he left his considerable savings to his son,
on condition that he never married a maid of
honour! A compliment to those ladies which they
no doubt appreciated.</p>

<p>Among the many amusements with which the
Prince and Princess delighted their friends, private
theatricals had their place, <i>Cato</i> being played on
one occasion at Leicester House, when the young
Prince George Frederick had grown sufficiently into
boyhood to take the part of Portius, in which he
was coached by Quin, who boasted he “had taught
the boy to speak”; the boy who was afterwards to
be George the Third.</p>

<p>For the little theatre at Cliefden, Thompson, a
pensioner of Frederick’s—and he had many—wrote
his play “Alfred.”</p>

<p>The Prince’s children came quickly, and Frederick
showed himself to be a tender father. There had been
that sad episode years before, when he had grieved
so deeply—so deeply that his mother and sisters had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
said they had not believed him capable of such
sorrow—over the death of that little child who had
no right to have been there at all, Anne Vane’s and
his son.</p>

<p>That sad note had struck the one most tender
chord in the despised Prince’s nature, the depths of
which his mother and sisters could not sound; the
love of little children. When his own grew up
around him, that great fount of love welled up and
covered many of his sins, as we know that love
will do.</p>

<p>This is what is said of him at that time:</p>

<p>“Notwithstanding this, he played the father and
husband well. He loved to have his children with
him, always appeared most happy when in the
bosom of his family, left them with regret, and met
them again with smiles, kisses and tears.”</p>

<p>And this was the nature which Queen Caroline
could not understand; was it not one full of love to
shower on <em>some one</em>? Had he but had the chance of
a mother’s full love in those cold years of his childhood
spent in Hanover, is it not reasonable to think
that his whole nature would have been altered, and
that he might have so wound himself around
Caroline’s heart that even her handsome younger son
could never have loosened those tendrils of affection.</p>

<p>But alas! there were those fourteen years of
separation, when the boy was left practically to his
own resources to grow up without the tenderness of
a mother’s love to guide him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span></p>

<p>How different was his conduct as a father to that
of his own father, who candidly admitted that he
could not bear to have his children playing about
in the same room with him.</p>

<p>But in this happy time of a young father’s life,
there were black clouds gathering over the Prince’s
household and this is how the old Duchess of Marlborough
speaks of them in her matter of fact way:</p>

<p>“They have found a way in the City to borrow
thirty thousand pounds for the Prince at ten per
cent. interest to pay his crying debts to trades-people.
But I doubt that sum won’t go very far.
But they have got it though great pains was taken
to hinder it.</p>

<p>“The salaries in the Prince’s family are twenty-five
thousand pounds a year, besides a good deal of
expense at Cliefden in building and furniture. And
the Prince and Princess’s allowance for their clothes
is six thousand pounds a year each. I wish his
Royal Highness so well that I am sorry there is
such an increase of expense more than in former
times, where there was more money a great deal,
and really I think it would have been more for the
Prince’s interest, if his counsellers had thought it
proper to have advised him to live only like a great
man, and to give the reasons for it; and in doing so
he would have made a better figure, and have been
safer; for nobody that does not get by it themselves
can possibly think the contrary method a right one.”
<i>The Duchess of Marlborough to Lord Stair</i>, 1738.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span></p>

<p>But though the pall of debt hung heavy over the
Prince, yet there was hope ahead, for even as far
back as 1737—it must have been the very end of
the year—Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, writes to
Lord Stair:—</p>

<p>It has been said that Frederick possessed artistic
tastes and loved to gather round him men of talent
and wit. He was also devoted to music, and gave
frequent private concerts at Leicester House in
which he himself took part.</p>

<p>One of Frederick’s favourites, a man devoted to
music like himself, was Horace Walpole’s brother,
Edward—afterwards Sir Edward—who frequently
performed with him at these concerts. The Prince,
however, made the mistake of introducing politics
at these meetings, and on one occasion while walking
about the room with his arm round Edward
Walpole’s shoulder, he endeavoured to persuade him
to keep from the House of Commons when a certain
Army Bill was under discussion, this being a
measure the Prince’s party wished to defeat.
Walpole, however, declined to give the required
promise, and when the Prince pressed him for his
motive answered:—</p>

<p>“You will forgive me, sir, if I give you my
reasons?”</p>

<p>“I will,” replied the Prince with an oath,
according to the prevailing fashion.</p>

<p>“Sir, you will not,” replied Walpole with another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
oath, “yet I will tell you. I will not stay away
because your father and mine are for the question.”</p>

<p>This was just the answer the Prince might have
expected from a son of the man who, perhaps, was
one of his greatest enemies. Nevertheless, he flung
away from Walpole, while one of the Princesses who
was at the harpsichord cried out: “Bravo, Mr.
Walpole.”</p>

<p>This made matters worse, and the Prince was
thoroughly incensed. Nevertheless, Mr. Edward
Walpole duly appeared at the next concert with his
violoncello, but the Prince had not apparently
forgiven him. At any rate, no doubt, by way of a
joke, he affected to regard him as one of the hired
musicians at the concert.</p>

<p>Edward Walpole, however, did not take the
matter as a joke, but rushed to the bell and ordered
his servants to be called to take away his violoncello.
He would be slighted, he remarked, by no
man.</p>

<p>The Prince, seeing that he had gone too far, tried
to pacify him, but Walpole would listen neither to
him nor to the peers and commoners who tried to
bring him back.</p>

<p>As might be expected, the Prince apologised,
and Walpole was at last persuaded to bring his
violoncello to the concerts.</p>

<p>But the house, of course, reeked with the politics of
the Opposition, and in a very short time Edward
Walpole was again solicited by some follower of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
Prince to join his party. Edward Walpole then
wrote his well-known letter to the Prince in which
he asks him, how he would wish him to behave
when he himself was King? In the same manner
would he behave while George the Second reigned.</p>

<p>“He is an honest man,” the Prince commented as
he read it, “I will keep this letter.”</p>

<p>He did keep it, and it was given many years
after to George the Third by his mother.</p>

<p>The Princess of Wales, it cannot be doubted, was
very much beloved by her husband. He had quite
forgotten that early love affair with his cousin,
Wilhelmina, and it is said was never tired of
appearing in public with Augusta, that the people
might frequently see and admire her; and admire
her they certainly did.</p>

<p>Even sharp-tongued old Sarah of Marlborough
had a kind word for her.</p>

<p>“The Princess speaks English much better than
any of the family that have been here so long,” she
wrote to her confidant, Lord Stair, “appears good-natured
and civil to everybody: never saying
anything to offend, as the late Queen did perpetually,
notwithstanding her great understanding
and goodness.”<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>Among other artistic accomplishments Frederick
wrote poetry, and the following verses addressed to
his wife under the name of “Sylvia” could only have
been written by a very devoted husband and lover:—</p>

was written immediately after the Battle of
Fontenoy, and was addressed to Lady Catherine
Hanmer, Lady Falconberg, and Lady Middlesex,
who were to act the three goddesses with Frederick,

Prince Lobkowitz, Mercury.</p>

<p>It may here be stated that in the year 1735 there
appeared in Paris a silly book which was attributed—by
his enemies—to Prince Frederick, or said to
be “inspired” by him, if that term could be applied
to a children’s fairy tale, for so it was regarded for
many years in France. It was translated into
English and published under the title of “The
Adventures of Prince Titi,” and was supposed to be
a travestie of the King and Queen.</p>

<p>As, however, no evidence exists to connect it with
the Prince of Wales, it deserves no further comment.</p>

<p>As an example of the way in which Prince
Frederick has been misrepresented in history, Dr.
Doran’s comment on the latter of the two above
songs in his “Queens of the House of Hanover”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
will be instructive; he says with reference to the
French song addressed by the Prince to the ladies
with whom he was going to act in “The Judgment
of Paris”:</p>

<p>“It was full of praise of late and deep drinking,
of intercourse with the fair,” an expression liable to
be misunderstood, “of stoical contempt for misfortune,
of expressed indifference, whether Europe
had one or many tyrants, and of a pococurantism for
all things and forms, except his <i lang="fr">chère Sylvie</i>, by
whom he was good-naturedly supposed to mean his
wife.”</p>

<p>Now Horace Walpole records the fact that
“Sylvie” was the Princess of Wales, and he
certainly cannot be credited with an abundance of
good-natured feeling towards the Prince.</p>

<p>If Dr. Doran thought all he wrote, then—Dr.
Doran’s knowledge of French—at least the Prince’s
French—could not have been perfect.</p>

<p>The English verses are not good; he was bred
abroad; but it is quite clear that the object of the
Prince’s love-rhapsodies in the French song is his
wife, though those rhapsodies are expressed in the
language of the time, none too delicately. Still for
a Prince to fall into passionate verse over the
delightful attractions of his wife is not a matter to
be jeered at; as far as we are permitted to search
into the private doings of such exalted personages,
history certainly conveys the impressions in divers
places, that their habit was usually to fall into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
passionate rhapsodies over somebody else’s wife, a
custom which has not been without honour in our
own time.</p>

<p>As regards our unfortunate Prince, nobody
appears to have thought him of sufficient importance
to write any sort of connected history about
him. When he had to be mentioned, the faithful
historian appears to have dived either into Hervey’s
“Memoirs” or those of Horace Walpole, and to
have taken all he found there as Gospel truth
without waiting to consider that both those
gentlemen were reckoned among the Prince’s
enemies; enemies who were not sufficiently gentlemen
to treat him with common fairness.</p>

<p>We have but to read the satires and pamphlets of
the time, many of them written or inspired by at
any rate one of the above staunch adherents of the
Prince’s parents, to see how much of fairness and
“<i lang="fr">noblesse</i>” was meted out to a political enemy in
those days even by men of education and supposed
refinement.</p>

<p>Under the date of 1748-9, Sarah Duchess of
Marlborough writes as follows to Lord Stair:—</p>

<p>“The Prince of Wales has done, I think, a very
right thing, for he has declared to everybody that
though he did design to bring the business of his
revenue into the House, he is now resolved not to
do it, it being but a trifle, and what could not
succeed after losing a question of so much
consequence for the preservation of the nation.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span></p>
<p>“But I think all this prudence will be of no use to
prevent France settling this country as that King
pleases, after we are still made poorer by what Sir
Robert has done, and will do further.”</p>

<p>It is much more likely that the Prince gave up
the idea of appealing to Parliament concerning his
income, because he had come to, or was about to
come to, some agreement with his father on this
much worried subject.</p>

<p>The Duchess writes again to Lord Stair in 1739
about the Prince: “I hear some people find fault
with the Prince’s having voted in the House of
Lords with the minority; but I can see no reason
for that. For surely he was as much at liberty to
do it as any other Peer; and I can’t comprehend
why he should not give his vote in anything that so
manifestly was for the good of England.”</p>

<p>This apparently concerned the Convention with
Spain.</p>

<p>The following is a word picture of the Prince at
the period of 1740, which appears a very vivid one.
It was contributed anonymously about the year
1830 to the <i>New European Magazine</i>, and was
evidently culled from some older publication. It
depicts the Prince during a visit to old “Bartlemy
Fair” in Smithfield.</p>

<p>“The multitude behind was impelled violently
forwards, and a broad blaze of red light, issuing
from a score of flambeaux, streamed into the air.
Several voices were loudly shouting “Room there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
for Prince Frederick! make way for the Prince!”
And there was that long sweep heard to pass over
the ground which indicates the approach of a grand
and ceremonious train. Presently the pressure
became much greater, the voices louder, the light
stronger, and as the train came onward, it might be
seen that it consisted firstly of a party of the
Yeomen of the Guard, clearing the way; then
several more of them bearing flambeaux, and
flanking the procession; while in the midst of all
appeared a tall, fair, and handsome young man,
having something of a plump foreign visage,
seemingly about four and thirty years of age,
dressed in a ruby-coloured frock coat, very richly
guarded with gold lace, and having his long flowing
hair curiously curled over his forehead and at the
sides, and finished with a very large bag and
courtly queue behind. The air of dignity with
which he walked; the blue ribbon and Star and
Garter with which he was decorated; the small,
three cornered, silk court-hat which he wore while
all around him were uncovered; the numerous
suite as well of gentlemen as of guards, which
marshalled him along; the obsequious attention of a
short stout person who, by his flourishing manner,
seemed to be a player; all these particulars indicated
that the amiable Frederick, Prince of Wales,
was visiting Bartholomew Fair by torchlight, and
that Manager Rich was introducing his royal guest
to all the amusements of the place.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span></p>

<p>To turn to another subject, it will be interesting
at the present time to note the strength of the
British Navy in this year 1740. Also those of
France and Spain. The information is contained
in “Minutes of the Cabinet” volume 4 of Lord
Hervey’s Memoirs, page 552 (Edition 1848).</p>

<p>An Account of the present Naval Strength
of England.</p>

<p>With Mr. Haddock<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> in the Mediterranean thirty-two
ships—twenty-two of the line, five twenty-gun
ships, three fire ships, two bomb vessels. All these
are at present with Haddock to defend Minorca
except four left at Gibraltar with Captain William
Hervey, brother to Lord Hervey, which properly
belong to (Sir Challoner) Ogle’s squadron of ten,
who went with the other six to join Haddock.
Balchen and Maine had ten to cruise on the
north-west of Spain, near Cape Finisterre and
Ferrol; but Maine’s five are returning home to
refit.</p>

<p>At home there are thirty ships for the Channel, to
guard our own coasts and protect this country; but
twenty only being manned, one third of the nominal
strength is absolutely useless.</p>

<p>In the West Indies there are now with Vernon
nine ships of the line, five fire ships, and two bomb
vessels; and dispersed in the West Indies about
sixteen ships more of different sizes.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span></p>

<h3>SPANISH STRENGTH IN EUROPE.</h3>

<p>At Carthagena five ships of the line, commanded
by Clavijo, who commanded the Cales (Cadiz)
squadron last year. The Cales squadron, nine ships
of the line, three frigates, commanded by Pintada.</p>

<p>The Ferrol Squadron, six ships of the line, and
the three Assogne ships refitting, and sixteen
thousand men in Galicia.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>On the Catalonia side of Spain several transport
ships, three men of war, seven thousand men in
Majorca; and another body of troops, commanded
by Count Celemis, in Catalonia, ready for an embarcation
at Barcelona, which Spain dare not hazard for
fear of Haddock’s Squadron ready in those seas to
intercept them. Their strength, or rather their
weakness in Spain, uncertain.</p>


<h3>FRENCH STRENGTH IN EUROPE.</h3>

<p>France has at Brest, ready to sail, commanded by
Monsieur D’Antin, a squadron of twenty-two
ships; the lowest accounts say eighteen; and at
Toulon twelve, all great ships from fifty-four to
seventy-four guns.</p>

<p>In 1741 the antagonism between the Prince and
his father had not subsided and party spirit was
strong, the followers of the King, such as Hervey
and others, did not scruple, as they had never
scrupled, to malign the Prince. There were, in
theory, two Courts, the King’s and the Prince’s, the
followers of both using the term “going to Court”
in speaking of their visits to their respective
masters. Walpole tells a story which bears upon
the point.</p>

<p>“Somebody who belonged to the Prince of Wales
said he was going to Court. It was objected, that
he ought to say ‘going to Carlton House’: that
the only Court is where the King resides. Lady
Pomfret, with her paltry air of learning and
absurdity, said: ‘Oh, Lord! is there no Court in
England but the King’s? sure there are many more!
There is the Court of Chancery, the Court of
Exchequer, the Court of King’s Bench, etc.’ ‘Don’t
you love her? Lord Lincoln does her daughter.’”</p>

<p>He refers to Lord Lincoln, one of the King’s
party, and a nephew of the Duke of Newcastle, one
of the Ministers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span></p>

<p>“Not only his uncle-duke,” continues Horace
Walpole, speaking of Lord Lincoln, “but even his
Majesty is fallen in love with him. He talked to
the King at his <i lang="fr">levée</i> without being spoken to. That
was always thought high treason, but I don’t know
how the gruff gentleman liked it.”</p>

<p>The “gruff” gentleman was of course the King.</p>

<p>The faction fever between the King’s party and
that of his son reached its height, however, in the
year 1742, when the Prince’s party combined with
other opponents of the Government and overthrew
the great Sir Robert Walpole after his many years
of office. So Queen Caroline’s trusted minister and
adviser fell at last.</p>

<p>He was succeeded by Lord Wilmington, who
practically carried on the same policy as his predecessor.</p>

<p>In this year died Lady Sundon, who had been
Mistress of the Robes to Queen Caroline and one of
her confidantes.</p>

<p>“Lord Sundon is in great grief,” writes Horace
Walpole. “I am surprised, for she has had fits of
madness ever since her ambition met such a check
by the death of the Queen. She had great power
with her, though the Queen affected to despise her,
but had unluckily told her, or fallen into her power,
by some secret. I was saying to Lady Pomfret ‘to
be sure she is dead very rich,’ she replied with some
warmth, ‘She never took money.’ When I came
home I mentioned this to Sir Robert. ‘No,’ said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
he, ‘but she took jewels. Lord Pomfret’s place of
Master of the Horse to the Queen was bought of her
for a pair of diamond earrings, of fourteen hundred
pounds value.’</p>

<p>“One day she wore them at a visit at old
Marlboro’s; as soon as she was gone, the duchess
said to Lady Mary Wortley, ‘How can that woman
have the impudence to go about in that bribe?’</p>

<p>“‘Madam,’ said Lady Mary, ‘how would you
have people know where wine is to be sold unless
there is a sign hung out?’</p>

<p>“Sir Robert told me that in the enthusiasm of
her vanity, Lady Sundon had proposed to him to
unite with her and govern the kingdom together;
he bowed, begged her patronage, but, he said, he
thought nobody fit to govern the kingdom but the
King and Queen.”</p>

<p>About the period of 1742 rumours of a fresh
Stuart rebellion began to permeate the country, and
it was probably this fact, together with the Prince
of Wales’s popularity with the public, which decided
the King to come to a reconciliation with him.
There was, however, now no Sir Robert to apply his
wonderful statesmanship in bringing about the
matter with the finesse and forethought he always
displayed in cases of this sort, though it must be
admitted that his arts had always been directed
against the Prince.</p>

<p>However, the matter was done, though clumsily.
It was commenced by a gentle hint given to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
Prince that a letter from him to his father would be
acceptable.</p>

<p>This proposition does not appear to have met at
first with the Prince’s favour, he, possibly, thinking
that the King owed him some reparation, and that
the first step should come from him. But he
eventually put his feelings in his pocket and wrote
his father the desired letter.</p>

<p>This letter reached the King late at night, and
he lost no time in responding to it; he expressed
his wish to receive the Prince on the following day.</p>

<p>Frederick repaired to St. James’s as desired,
attended by five of his suite. He was received by
his father in one of the drawing-rooms, and the
interview must have been an exceedingly interesting
one for the onlookers from its importance, but its
duration was bound within the limits of the strictest
formality.</p>

<p>“How does the Princess do? I hope she is well,”
was the sole scrap of conversation which passed
King George’s lips, if chroniclers of the time can be
credited. The Prince kissed his father’s hand,
answered the question concerning his wife’s health,
and—withdrew.</p>

<p>There appears, however, to have been a little
burying of the hatchet on both sides. The King
spoke to one or two of the Prince’s followers. The
Prince unbent, and addressed a few courtesies to his
father’s attending Ministers, and the thing was
over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span></p>

<p>The reconciliation, however, appears to have been
universally regarded as an accomplished fact, and
the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>, in its next issue, thus
records it:—</p>

<p>Wednesday, February 17th, 1742.</p>

<p>“Several messages having passed yesterday
between his Majesty and the Prince of Wales, his
Royal Highness waited on his Majesty at St. James’s
about one o’clock this day, and met with a most
gracious reception. Great joy was shown in all
parts of the kingdom upon this happy reconciliation.”</p>

<p>This reconciliation is said to have been worth an
additional fifty thousand pounds a year to the
Prince, and Horace Walpole remarks on it.</p>

<p>“He will have money now to tune Glover and
Thompson and Dodsley again, <i lang="la">et spes et ratio
studiorum in Cæsare tantum</i>.”</p>

<p>The whole of the Royal Family went after this
together to the Duchess of Norfolk’s—the old house
by the river, no doubt—the streets being “illuminated
and bonfired.” There were pageants and reviews to
celebrate the reconciliation, and the Prince and
Princess made a sort of triumphal progress through
the city to show themselves to their good friends
the Corporation; then entering their barges at the
Tower steps they finished up the day in a very
sensible manner by dining at Greenwich, where they
no doubt partook of whitebait and turtle.</p>

<p>Those processions of gilded barges on the Thames,
accompanied as they generally were by music, must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
have been stately sights for the citizens to view, and
much missed when the river became too crowded
and dirty to be used as a royal highway.</p>

<p>In 1743 died Schulemberg, the mistress of George
the First, whom he created Duchess of Kendal.
The Emperor of Germany had also for some
unstated reason conferred on her the dignity of
Princess of Eberstein.</p>

<p>She died at the age of eighty-five, possessed of
great wealth, which she bequeathed to Lady
Walsingham, generally supposed to be her daughter
by George the First.</p>

<p>Lady Walsingham had previously married Lord
Chesterfield.</p>

<p>“But, I believe,” remarks Horace Walpole, “that
he will get nothing by the Duchess’s death but his
wife. She lived in the house with the Duchess”—next
door in Grosvenor Square, “where he had played
away all his credit.”</p>

<p>But at this time war clouds were hanging over
Europe, and King George had espoused the cause of
Queen Maria Theresa of Hungary. Very soon his
attention was drawn from his eldest son to be
centred in this cause, in which his favourite son
William took a part.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.<br><span class="small"><span class="smcap">The Battle of Dettingen.</span></span></h2></div>


<p>On the 21st of April, 1743, King George prorogued
Parliament, and almost immediately hastened
over to Hanover accompanied by his son, William,
Duke of Cumberland, and Lord Carteret as Secretary
of State, in attendance. The object of this
departure was to aid Queen Maria Theresa of
Hungary in her struggle against the French and
Bavarians, and in so doing to gratify an ambition
long cherished by King George to place himself
at the head of an allied army. For whatever
failings the little King is credited with, and we
know he had many—those <i lang="fr">foiblesses</i> of which we
have been so frequently reminded—he was certainly
a soldier, and a brave one.</p>

<p>Probably also he had a great desire to establish a
reputation as a soldier for his favourite son William,
also, that young man having at a very early period
displayed a considerable penchant for the military
art.</p>

<p>This preference for his brother was very far from
gratifying to the Prince of Wales, who would have
much liked to have gone to the wars himself,
although his training had never been in that
direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span></p>

<p>But to give him a command was about the last
thing that King George would have thought of
doing. Such an act would have given his eldest
son fresh popularity, which he was far from desiring.</p>

<p>Not only was Frederick denied a command, but
he was also excluded from the regency which his
father left behind him. Sir Robert Walpole
remarked as follows upon it:</p>

<p>“I think the Prince might have been of it, when
Lord Gower is. I don’t think the latter more
Jacobite than his Royal Highness.” So once more,
as far as any active participation in the affairs of
the state were concerned, the Prince of Wales was
left in the galling position of being on the shelf.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the British troops under the Earl of
Stair, had commenced their march towards the end
of February into Germany, but appear to have
moved with incredible slowness as it was the
middle of May before they crossed the Rhine.</p>

<p>Lord Stair—the celebrated correspondent of
Sarah Duchess of Marlborough,—appears to have
been a very poor sort of a general, and in addition
was hampered for want of a proper commissariat,
which was not understood in those days.</p>

<p>There appeared to be the same happy-go-lucky
state of affairs—which seems to be national and
chronic—to which the great Marlborough referred
in 1702, by calling his native country: “England
that is famous for negligence.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span><a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
Lord Stair’s army, however, struggled onward, and
was joined on the way by some sixteen thousand
Hanoverians in British pay, who had been in winter
quarters in Liège, and by a few Austrian regiments.
Eventually they all arrived at Hochst, between
Mayence and Frankfort, and here Lord Stair’s
command numbered about forty thousand men.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the French commander-in-chief, the
Maréchal de Noailles, with sixty-thousand men,
crossed the Rhine and approached the Southern
bank of the River Maine, the northern bank of
which was occupied by the British.</p>

<p>It is an extraordinary thing that although these
two armies stood facing one another, prepared for
battle—a battle which came off very soon—their
respective countries had not broken off diplomatic
relations with one another.</p>

<p>Horace Walpole refers to it as follows:</p>

<p>“A ridiculous situation! we have the name of
War with Spain without the thing, and War with
France without the name.”</p>

<p>Lord Stair appears to have entirely lost his head
under these circumstances and to have made a series
of imbecile marches and countermarches, which
thoroughly tired out his horses and men and left him
and his army at their conclusion in a worse position
than they were before, with the addition that they
were exceeding short of food and forage. The
French General had entirely out-manœuvred Stair.</p>

<p>At this juncture—19th July, 1743—King George<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
and his son, the Duke of Cumberland, joined the
English army, which was at that time hemmed in
in a narrow valley extending from Aschaffenberg to
the considerable village of Dettingen on the north
bank of the River Maine.</p>

<p>Here, after several counsels of War, it was
decided to fall back on Hanau, a town where a
magazine of provisions had been established. At
this period the horses had but two days’ rations of
forage left, all other supplies being cut off by the
French.</p>

<p>The difficult retreat was commenced in face of the
enemy—on the other bank of the River Maine—who
immediately, as might have been expected from such
a celebrated General as de Noailles, pontooned the
river, and sent twenty-three thousand men across,
under his nephew the Duc de Grammont to stop the
retreat of the British and their allies at the defile of
Dettingen, through which they must pass to reach
their supplies at Hanau, sixteen miles further on.</p>

<p>So that the battle of Dettingen may be referred
to as a “bread-and-butter” fight on the part of the
British, who fought possibly all the better on
that account.</p>

<p>The march of the English on Dettingen began
before daylight on the 27th of June, the King at
first commanding the rear guard, which was considered
through ignorance of the movements of the
French, to be the point of danger.</p>

<p>When, however, the advance guard was driven in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
at Dettingen and French troops came pouring
across the river, King George and his son rode
along the column to the front, where they appear to
have taken supreme command at once.</p>

<p>Now the British Army was in a very tight corner
indeed; no sooner had they marched than the
Marquis de Noailles, perfectly alive to the situation,
sent twelve thousand men to occupy Aschaffenberg
in their rear; thus with twenty-three thousand men
in a strong entrenched position in their front
between them and their stores of food, the river on
their left, and a force of twelve thousand in their
rear, the position of the British looked pretty hopeless,
hemmed in as they were in addition by hills on
the right. Across the river a strong force of
artillery was posted, which commenced a heavy fire
into the left flank of our regiments, mowing down
whole ranks. It was a position which at any
moment might have been turned into a panic. That
it was <em>not</em> turned into a panic and a rout is entirely
owing to the courage and military skill of George
the Second.</p>

<p>As far as courage was concerned, he was ably
seconded by his son the Duke of Cumberland, but
as this was his first fight, his military knowledge
was <em>nil</em>, and it never shone particularly at any time
after.</p>

<p>With all his faults and frailties and “<i lang="fr">foiblesses</i>,”
little King George on this day showed himself to be
a skilled soldier, and a brave man. His previous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
reputation gained at Oudenarde had not been forgotten
by our own poets when he came to England
and became Prince of Wales; one of them had thus
addressed him on a birthday:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Let Oudenarde’s field your courage tell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who looked so martial, or who fought so well?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who charg’d the foe with greater fire or force?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who felt unmoved the trembling falling horse?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sound, sound, O Fame, the trumpet loud and true,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All, all, this blaze to my Prince George is due.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In early life such deeds in arms were done</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As prove you able to defend the throne.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He had then a well-established reputation for
courage, which was no doubt well known to the men
he commanded.</p>

<p>The King and his son rode from their station in
the rear to the front, and there the former at once
deployed the columns into line with the left resting
on the river and the right on the slopes of the hills
at the other side of the valley. The infantry were
in front with the half-starved cavalry in reserve.</p>

<p>The British Army was in presence of perhaps the
most accomplished general of his time, Maréchal
Noailles, and he had selected his position before
Dettingen—an old post village—with consummate
judgment.</p>

<p>It had a ravine, the course of a small rivulet
running across its front, while its right flank rested
on a morass and the river. The only mistake the
Maréchal had made was in placing his hot-headed
nephew the Duc de Grammont in command of it.
This circumstance led to a big stroke of luck in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
King George’s favour at the very commencement of
the action.</p>

<p>The Duc de Grammont committed the common
and deadly error of despising his enemy; believing
the advancing force to be but a part of the British
Army, he left his entrenchments with the object
apparently, of crushing it before its main body came
up, but it was in fact the main body, which he had
to engage. This advance had a double effect in
favour of King George; the French guns across the
river, which had been making fearful play on the
English ranks, had to cease fire, as the French very
soon came in close proximity to their foes, and were
as likely to be hit by their own gunners as the
English. Therefore our men were relieved from this
demoralizing flank fire. This movement of the Duc
de Grammont rendered the excellent dispositions of
his uncle valueless.</p>

<p>But an untoward incident, at the very commencement,
delayed for a time the fruits of this
error being gathered and very nearly deprived the
British Army of its royal commander; King
George’s horse ran away with him in the direction
of the enemy.</p>

<p>This was a paralysing spectacle for our own
men!</p>

<p>Fortunately, however, the King succeeded in
pulling him round before he got close enough for the
French to grab him, and he returned in safety if not
in triumph to his own lines. This incident,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
however, determined the brave little man to take a
certain course; he got off his horse.</p>

<p>“I vill go on my legs,” he remarked cheerfully,
“dey cannot run away with me!”</p>

<p>But the enemy’s cavalry, composed of the <i lang="fr">élite</i> of
the French Army, were now advancing; the King
drew his sword and placed himself at the head of
his Grenadiers. Waving his sword, he cheered
them on, the last King of England who led his
soldiers into battle.</p>

<p>“Now boys,” he cried, “now for the honour of
England; fire and behave bravely, and the French
will soon run!”</p>

<p>All this was very fine, but the French did <em>not</em>
run, at first; they came on in a wild charge and
considerably shook our infantry, so much so, that it
required all the energy of the King and his son—who,
with the rank of Major-General, led the left
wing—to get them steady again. The father and
son certainly did not spare themselves on this day;
even when the Duke was wounded in the leg he
refused to leave the field. No wonder that poor
Frederick at home was boiling with jealousy.</p>

<p>Maréchal Noailles from the other side of the river,
where he was organizing a supporting movement,
saw his nephew’s error, and hastened back to
Dettingen; but he arrived too late.</p>

<p>King George, at the head of a brigade of infantry,
had swept the French from their position and
cleared the road to Hanau and the much needed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
food and stores. The French loss in the retreat was
frightfully heavy, and the French Maréchal very
wisely drew off the remainder of his troops to the
other side of the river, with a list of killed and
wounded which totalled up to six thousand men.</p>

<p>Thus ended the Battle of Dettingen, concerning
King George’s part in which, Justin McCarthy in
his “Four Georges,” makes the following comment:—</p>

<p>“George behaved with a great courage and spirit.
If the poor, stupid, puffy, plucky little man did
but know what a strange, picturesque, memorable
figure he was as he stood up against the enemy at
the Battle of Dettingen! The last King of England
who ever appeared with his army in the battlefield.
There, as he gets down off his unruly horse,
determined to trust to his own stout legs—because
as he says, they will not run away—there is the
last successor of the Williams, and the Edwards,
and the Henrys; the last successor of the Conqueror,
and Edward the First, and the Black Prince,
and Henry the Fourth, and Henry of Agincourt,
and William of Nassau; the last English King who
faces a foe in battle.”</p>

<p>King George returned to England covered with
glory in September, 1743, and finding himself
popular took that opportunity of snubbing once more
the Prince of Wales, and ignoring his presence as
heretofore. This was particularly ungracious, as the
Princess was at the time lying ill.</p>

<p>The King must have sadly missed his Minister,
and trusty adviser of twenty-one years, Sir Robert
Walpole, now created Earl of Orford, Viscount
Walpole and Baron of Houghton, but none the less
“Sir Robert Walpole” to the people and posterity.
Though the great statesman—the peaceful statesman,
despite his other faults—had retired
immediately on his fall in February, 1742, to his
estate at Houghton, yet it is perfectly clear that his
old master frequently consulted him, on the many
points of trouble which were now arising around
him, and that meetings took place between them,
notwithstanding the fact that determined efforts
were being made to impeach the Earl; attempts
which signally failed. There is no doubt that in
responding to a call from the King to come and
advise him on some knotty point—the coming
Scottish rebellion it may be—Walpole met his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
death. The house of a Mr. Fowler, a Commissioner
of Excise, in Golden Square, was the rendezvous
where Walpole received the King’s messages.</p>

<p>For there had long been unrest in the North, and
rumours of the coming of the Pretender’s son.</p>

<p>It was in answer to such a summons from King
George that Walpole left Houghton for London,
though suffering from a painful malady, and greatly
increased it by the journey. So great was his pain
that he had to be kept under the influence of opium
for the greater part of the day, but it is said that
during the few hours that his mind was clear, his
conversation had all the life and brilliancy of former
times, which during his retirement to Norfolk, a
lonely old man, had entirely left him. However,
these moments were but the last expiring flashes of
his great intellect. He died on the 18th March,
1745, just at the time when he was most needed by
the King, at the commencement of that fateful year
for England, when Bonnie Prince Charlie came over
the water, raised an army in Scotland, and made a
victorious march on air, almost to London itself.</p>

<p>Charles Edward Louis Philip Casimir, son of the
Old Pretender, James Stuart, and his wife
Clementine Sobieski—granddaughter of John
Sobieski, King of Poland—and grandson of James
the Second of England, was born in Rome in 1720,
consequently when he started on his expedition to
Scotland he was about twenty-five.</p>

<p>Lord Mahon describes him as follows:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span></p>

<p>“The person of Charles (I begin with this for the
sake of female readers) was tall and well formed;
his limbs athletic and active. He excelled in all
manly exercises, and was inured to every kind of
toil, especially long marches on foot, having applied
himself to field sports in Italy, and become an
excellent walker.</p>

<p>“His face was strikingly handsome, of a perfect
oval and a fair complexion; his eyes light blue; his
features high and noble. Contrary to the custom of
the time which prescribed perukes, his own fair hair
usually fell in long ringlets on his neck.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> This
goodly person was enhanced by his graceful
manners; frequently condescending to the most
familiar kindness, yet always shielded by a regal
dignity; he had a peculiar talent to please and to
persuade, and never failed to adapt his conversation
to the taste, or to the station of those whom he
addressed.”</p>

<p>(At the age of thirteen, Pope Innocent the XII
pronounced Prince Charlie, dressed in a little bright
cuirass and a rich point lace cravat, “truly an
angel.”)</p>

<p>Such was the man who came secretly from France
in August, 1745, with but two ships, to challenge
Frederick’s right to the title of Prince of Wales.</p>

<p>The two aforesaid vessels of Prince Charlie being
chased by men-of-war and somewhat roughly
handled, they had to separate, so that it was simply
an unconvoyed little merchant ship which at last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
brought the Stuart to the western isles. There at
first he passed as a young English clergyman come
to see the Highlands; but on the 19th of that
month of August, he threw off his clerical garb
and raising his standard at Glenfinnan called the
clans to assemble round it.</p>

<p>Here he was joined by six hundred of the
Camerons under their chief Lochiel, Keppoch with
three hundred of his men, and many other smaller
parties.</p>

<p>With a war chest of but four thousand louis d’or,
which he had brought with him, and a very varied
collection of arms, Prince Charlie the next morning
commenced a march which ended only at Derby,
one hundred and twenty miles from London, and
which, if persevered in, would have led him in all
probability, to the steps of the English throne.</p>

<p>At this time King George the Second was in
Hanover, but so alarming were the reports which
reached him of the Stuart Prince’s doings, that he
set out at once, and on the 31st of August reached
London.</p>

<p>This absence of the King in Hanover, is pretty
strong evidence that the movements of the young
invader had been conducted in absolute secrecy.</p>

<p>The King on his arrival found, however, that the
Regency—which apparently did not include the
Prince of Wales—had not been idle. Warrants had
been issued against the Duke of Perth and Sir
Hector Maclean, but the former escaped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span></p>

<p>The Dutch had also been called upon to supply
six thousand auxiliaries according to contract, a
decision had been come to to recall some of the
regiments from Flanders, the nucleus of an army
was being formed at Newcastle under Marshal
Wade, and some of the militia had been called
out.</p>

<p>The spirit of the people, however, remained perfectly
passive; probably they looked upon the
incursion of Prince Charlie as a sort of filibustering
expedition similar to that of his father in 1715,
which would soon fizzle out.</p>

<p>Henry Fox, who was at the time a member of
the Government, thus records this apathy on the
part of the public in confidential letters to Sir C. H.
Williams. He writes on September 5th, 1745:</p>

<p>“England, Wade says, and I believe, is for the
first comer; and if you can tell whether the six
thousand Dutch and the ten battalions of English,
or five thousand French or Spaniards will be there
first, you will know our fate....”</p>

<p>He continues on September 19th:</p>

<p>“God be thanked! But had five thousand landed
on any part of this island a week ago, I verily
believe the entire conquest would not have cost
them a battle.”</p>

<p>The King, however, was persuaded that the affair
was of no importance, and promptly snubbed the
Prince of Wales when he asked for a command.
Even a regiment was denied him, while his younger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>
brother was given a brigade straight away in
Flanders two years before!</p>

<p>Frederick upon this stood apart as it were, with
his arms folded, and contemplated the preparations
cynically.</p>

<p>Matters stood in this wise until well on into
September, when news arrived of the total defeat of
Sir John Cope’s army at Preston Pans on September
20th.</p>

<p>What was more surprising than this, however, was
the news of the Prince’s exceeding moderation and
kindness to the vanquished.</p>

<p>He showed himself on this occasion of victory, as
indeed he did at all times in the campaign, a kind-hearted
and honourable gentleman, who could have
taken his place among the knights in the days of
chivalry.</p>

<p>Had Charles been able to pursue his victory, and
to have made a forced march into England, he might
soon have ended the matter, but most of his Highlanders
disappeared for the time to put their share
of the spoil of the battle in safe places in the
mountains.</p>

<p>However, within six weeks he had an army of six
thousand men again round his standard at Holyrood,
and with these he presently set forth again towards
England.</p>

<p>To his credit be it said that his army was an
orderly one; all irregularities he repressed with a
firm hand. True it might have happened sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
that his Highlanders would stop some
prosperous looking traveller on the road and level
their firelocks at him, but when the trembling victim
inquired what they wanted the answer generally
was “a baubee,” <i>i.e.</i>, a halfpenny.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>But the march to England was an exceedingly
unpopular one with the Highlanders, and many of
them deserted during the first few days and went
home; the remainder were difficult to deal with,
and it is said that one morning Prince Charles had
to argue with them for an hour and a half before he
could get them to march at all.</p>

<p>However, they reached Kelso and there halted for
two days. In the accounts of this extraordinary
march what strikes one particularly is the wonderfully
good generalship displayed by Lord George
Murray, who commanded the first division, and who,
time after time, out-manœuvred the best of King
George’s generals, evading and misleading them with
the greatest ease, until he finally placed the mobile
little army which he commanded between the King’s
forces and London.</p>

<p>From Kelso Lord George made the first of his
excellent feints. He sent forward messengers to
prepare quarters for his troops at Wooler; this
was to deceive Marshal Wade, and draw off his
attention from Carlisle, which was really the object
of Murray’s attack.</p>

<p>Wade fell into the trap, while the Prince’s forces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
made a forced march down Liddisdale and entered
Cumberland and laid siege to Carlisle.</p>

<p>This important frontier fortress was in a bad state.
The garrison of the Castle consisted of about a
company of invalid soldiers, while the defences of
the town itself were old and mouldering. Nevertheless
there was here a large body of Cumberland
militia raised for King George, while the attacking
force had only a few four-pounder cannon to bring
against it. But in five days, though the Mayor
began by a good show of resistance, the town and
Castle surrendered to Prince Charles, providing him
with an abundance of arms and ammunition.</p>

<p>With regard to this siege of Carlisle, a great deal
has been made by the enemies of Frederick, Prince
of Wales, of an incident which occurred concerning
it at this time.</p>

<p>It so happened that a representation of the
Castle of Carlisle—in pastry—was served up at the
Prince’s table—it must be remembered that his
table was supplied by a caterer—no doubt it was
intended by the cook as a surprise, such as cooks
are very fond of preparing for their masters.</p>

<p>Great exception has been taken to the fact that
the Prince <em>and</em> the Maids of Honour—these Maids
of Honour seemed prone to evil—bombarded the
sham castle with sugar plums! What else could be
expected from a parcel of Maids of Honour and a
lighthearted Prince who rolled Bubb Doddington,
in all his priggish solemnity, down a flight of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
stairs in a blanket? Yet the Prince’s traducers
endeavoured to give the incident a political significance
as a sign of the Prince’s indifference to the
sufferings of the besieged!</p>

<p>As a matter of fact it was a most bloodless siege,
and only lasted five days, the garrison marching out
and going home unmolested.</p>

<p>From Carlisle, with four thousand five hundred
men, Prince Charlie marched by Shaw, Kendal and
Lancaster to Preston, where he arrived on November
27th. Very different marching this to the progress
of our army under Lord Stair, when moving from
Flanders to the banks of the Maine in 1743, which
progress took, as we have seen, four months!</p>

<p>Preston was regarded by the Highlanders as a
fatal barrier, beyond which they could not pass, as
the Duke of Hamilton had been defeated there in
the Civil Wars, and Brigadier Macintosh surrendered
at the same spot in 1715.</p>

<p>To break this tradition Lord George Murray
marched across and beyond the Ribble bridge.</p>

<p>From Preston, Prince Charlie pushed on to
Wigan and Manchester, still unopposed, for the
aged Marshal Wade had withdrawn to Newcastle
on finding the mountain roads around him blocked
with snow.</p>

<p>The following is a description of Charles’s entry
into Manchester, given in the letter of a spy
stationed there and sent to the Duke of Cumberland:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span></p>

<p class="right">
“28th November.<br>
</p>

<p>“Just now are come in two of the Pretender’s
men, a sergeant, a drummer, and a woman with
them. I have seen them; the sergeant is a Scotchman,
the drummer is a Halifax man, and they are
now going to beat up. These two men and the
woman, without any others, came into the town
amidst thousands of spectators. I doubt not we
shall have more to-night. They say we’re to have
the Pretender to-morrow. They are dressed in
plaids and bonnets. The sergeant has a target.”</p>

<p class="right">
“29th November.<br>
</p>

<p>“The two Highlanders who came in yesterday
and beat up for volunteers for him they called His
Royal Highness Charles, Prince of Wales, offered five
guineas advance; many took on; each received one
shilling to have the rest when the Prince came.</p>

<p>“They do not appear to be such terrible fellows
as has been represented. Many of the foot are
diminutive creatures, but many clever men among
them. The Guards and officers are all in a Highland
dress, a long sword and stuck with pistols; their
horses all sizes and colours.</p>

<p>“The bellman went to order all persons charged
with excise, and innkeepers forthwith to appear,
and bring their last acquittance, and as much ready
cash as that contains on pain of military execution.
It is my opinion they will make all haste possible
through Derbyshire to evade fighting Ligonier. I
do not see that we have any person in town to give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
intelligence to the King’s forces as all our men of
fashion are fled, and all officers under the government.
A party came in at ten this morning, and
have been examining the best houses, and have
fixed upon Mr. Dicconson’s for the Prince’s quarters.
Several thousands came in at two o’clock; they
ordered the bells to ring, and the bellman has been
ordering us to illuminate our houses to-night, which
must be done. The Chevalier marched by my door
in a Highland dress, on foot, at three o’clock, surrounded
by a Highland guard; no music but a pair
of bagpipes.</p>

<p>“Those that came in last night demanded
quarters for ten thousand men to-day.”<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>Prince Charlie, however, did not beat up many
recruits in Manchester, and altogether the military
outlook began to appear very ominous.</p>

<p>This was the position in which the invading
Army found itself. On their rear, Marshal Wade
was slowly crawling after them through Yorkshire.
In front was the Duke of Cumberland with eight
thousand men, his head-quarters at Lichfield. Outside
London, at Finchley, was another army, which
although it contained the Royal Guards, was composed
chiefly of newly raised troops. This, it was
said, was to be commanded by the King in person.
Chester was held by Lord Cholmondeley, its
neighbour Liverpool by the citizens for King
George; and the bridges over the Mersey were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
broken down. Admiral Vernon cruised with a
strong Fleet in the Channel to prevent a French
invasion or landing of supplies, whilst Admiral Byng
was off the East coast of Scotland with a squadron
with the like intention.</p>

<p>Despite, however, all these obstacles to his
success, Prince Charlie was for going on to London,
and in this intention he was to a certain extent
supported by Lord George Murray, who in his
usual consummate way, hoodwinked the enemy and
picked his way through them with the greatest
ease to Derby, where he was joined by the Prince
with his division on the 4th of December. Here
the advance into England came to a dead stop, even
Lord George Murray advised a retreat into Scotland
again, whence news had just arrived that Lord
John Drummond had landed at Montrose with the
Regiment of the Royal Scots and other supports
and supplies.</p>

<p>It is a moot question still whether, if Prince
Charlie had had his own way—which he insisted
pretty strongly upon for some time, and marched
straight on London where he had mostly new levies
of militia to deal with, he might not have attained
his object.</p>

<p>He was but one hundred and twenty-seven miles
from London, and the state of affairs in the capital
can best be judged by the following account of a
loyal writer who was in London at the time:</p>

<p>“When the Highlanders, by a most incredible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
march, got between the Duke’s army and the
metropolis, they struck a terror into it scarcely to
be credited.”<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>An immediate rush was made upon the Bank of
England which only escaped bankruptcy by paying
in sixpences to gain time. Shops were shut and
business suspended. The Duke of Newcastle, the
Minister who occupied Sir Robert Walpole’s place,
“stood trembling and amazed.” It is also stated
that King George had some of his “most precious
effects—did these include the Walmoden?”—removed
on board his yachts, which were ordered to
remain at the Tower Quay ready to sail at a
moment’s notice. It is not thought likely that he
offered the Prince of Wales a passage in either of
these, neither is Frederick mentioned at this time
although no doubt he was with the troops at
Finchley.</p>

<p>But all these fears in London were groundless.
Prince Charles’s officers had determined among
themselves to retreat from Derby back to Scotland,
and the broken-hearted Prince at last reluctantly
consented.</p>

<p>By the same road they returned, hotly pursued a
part of the way by the Duke of Cumberland with
some thousands of horse; but after a rear-guard
action at the village of Clifton, near Penrith, in
which he lost a hundred men, killed and wounded,
the Duke drew off leaving the Chevalier to retreat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
in peace to Glasgow, which he reached on the 26th
of December, concluding this marvellous winter’s
march of eight hundred and eighty-two miles in
fifty-six days, some of which were of course resting
days.</p>

<p>From this time forward the struggle was really
one between the Prince and the Duke of Cumberland
as the aged Marshal Wade was superseded,
and Henry Hawley, one of the Duke of Cumberland’s
generals, took his place. Prince Charles,
however, having been reinforced by Lord Strathallan
and Lord John Drummond, easily defeated
General Hawley at Falkirk, on the 17th January,
1746, taking many prisoners, one of whom, probably
an Irishman, is recorded to have remarked:</p>

<p>“By my soul, if Charlie goes on in this way,
Prince Frederick will never be King George.”</p>

<p>The authorities in London were soon thoroughly
aroused by this victory of the Highlanders, and
determined upon sending the Duke of Cumberland
to take supreme command in Scotland, all danger of
an invasion of England being over. Thus began
that memorable campaign of Cumberland’s, which
culminated in Culloden, and—from his savage
cruelty to the wounded at that place—covered his
name for evermore with infamy.</p>

<p>William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland at this
time, was only in his twenty-fifth year, having been
born on April 15th, 1721, and was just four months
younger than Prince Charlie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span></p>

<p>He possessed, however, none of the graces of
person of his Stuart cousin. Though not yet
twenty-five, he was exceedingly corpulent and unwieldy,
and had a rough uncouth manner and a
savage temper; in fact he looked exactly what he
was afterwards called, “The Butcher.” It was into
such a man as this, that the handsome idolized son
of Caroline had grown.</p>

<p>There could not possibly have been a greater
contrast between any two persons than between
these two young men who were destined to fight to
a finish this contest for the throne of England.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that Cumberland had lost the
battle of Fontenoy, the military authorities seemed
to feel sufficient confidence in him to send him to
Scotland to take the supreme command at such a
critical period. Certainly his father believed in his
military talents such as they were.</p>

<p>He received his appointment very soon after the
arrival in London of the news of the defeat of
Falkirk, and left, as he was requested to do, without
delay, and travelled night and day, arriving unexpectedly
at Holyrood on the 31st of January;
here he chose the very bed in which Prince Charlie
had slept.</p>

<p>In Edinburgh he found his favourite, General
Hawley, busily engaged in hanging his own men,
right and left, for having run away from the
Highlanders at Falkirk. He had prepared the gallows
for the Prince’s followers, and was using it for his own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span></p>

<p>These executions Cumberland at once stopped.</p>

<p>An incident, which occurred in Flanders, will
give an idea of the nature of this brute Hawley, a
very fit second-in-command, for such a man as
Cumberland afterwards proved himself to be.
During the campaign in the Low Countries when
Hawley commanded a regiment, one of his own men,
a deserter, had been hanged before his windows. So
pleasant a sight did he find it, that when the
surgeons came to beg the body for dissection he
was very loth to part with it.</p>

<p>“At least,” he said at last, “you shall give me
the skeleton to hang up in the guard-room!”</p>

<p>Fancy a spruce Colonel of a line-battalion of our
own day ordering a guard-room to be decorated
in this fashion! Cumberland remained little more
than twenty-four hours in Edinburgh, then moved
out to find the Prince’s army, which he understood
lay at Falkirk; his men appeared to have advanced
with every confidence in him.</p>

<p>Charles had, however, much against his will,
commenced a retreat towards the Highlands, where
his generals had persuaded him with much difficulty
to pass the remainder of the winter.</p>

<p>This retreat appears to have been conducted with
carelessness and disorder, and much baggage was
lost to the pursuing English troops. However,
Crieff was reached, and here the two divisions
marched by different roads towards Inverness.</p>

<p>It seems pitiable to contrast the position of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
Prince’s army from this time forth, sown with
dissension, wandering about in the cold northern
winter and spring among barren mountains from
which it was impossible to break forth, without
food or money.</p>

<p>Charles at this period was reduced to his last
five hundred louis d’or and had to pay his troops in
meal, which course ended as might have been
expected, in many desertions.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Duke of Cumberland’s army was
well fed and clothed and reinforced by five
thousand Hessians, who had been hired by the
government. These troops, however, did not take
part in the subsequent battle, but held the line
of communications.</p>

<p>But the end came at last. Cumberland having
fixed his Headquarters at Aberdeen, moved out of
that place on the 8th of April, 1746, with about
eight thousand infantry, and nine hundred cavalry
and marched <i>via</i> Banff and the river Spey on Nairn,
which town he entered on the 14th April.</p>

<p>That night, Charles, who had come up with his
Guards, slept at Culloden House, the seat of President
Forbes, one of his principal enemies, his men
to the number of about five thousand bivouacing on
the moor using the heath during the bitter night
both for bed and fuel.</p>

<p>There seems to have been an excellent project
formed in the Prince’s Council, by Lord George
Murray, to make a night attack upon Cumberland,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>
which would have stood a good chance of success
as the 15th April, being the Duke’s birthday, his
soldiers had spent it in drink and carousing, supplies
being plentiful, as a fleet laden with provisions
followed them along the coast.</p>

<p>The night march, however, from a proper want of
direction, proved a lamentable failure, and only
served to further exhaust the half-starved Highlanders,
who returned worn out, to Drummossie or
Culloden Moor.</p>

<p>There, on the 16th, with the ration of one biscuit
per man, they stood up to meet the well-fed, well-equipped
army of Cumberland twice their number.
The result is not to be wondered at.</p>

<p>Their ranks, ploughed by the superior artillery of
the English, with a storm of snow and hail blowing
full in their faces, the starved Highland men
endured their position without a murmur, until
the order was given by Lord George Murray to
charge.</p>

<p>The Clan of the Macdonalds refused the order;
but the right and centre in one wild rush, swept
down on Cumberland’s men and broke through
the first line, capturing two guns.</p>

<p>But there were two lines beyond, and these
closing up, and standing three deep, poured such
a volley into the Highlanders that their charge
was shattered by it. That ended the matter;
the Prince’s army, which had never before suffered
defeat, broke and fled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span></p>

<p>Had the Macdonalds taken part in the charge,
the battle might have ended differently; but after
one volley, they remained spectators of the action,
sulking because they were not placed on the
right wing.</p>

<p>No sooner was the charge of the Highlanders
broken than the English regiments closed in upon
them with the bayonet. Cumberland had with
some skill, instructed his men not to use their
bayonets on the adversaries immediately in front
of them in a melée, who were protected by their small
shields, but to stab sideways at the assailants of
their right hand men; what was to become of the
unfortunate man on the extreme left of the line
apparently was not stated in the Duke’s order.
Against the solid press of the well-fed English
soldiers, at least two to one, the broken half-starved
Highlanders could make no way, and for
the first time in the whole campaign fell back
before them; the Macdonalds on the left wing
being the only part of the line which retreated
in anything like order. So far the battle had
been fairly fought, and the Scots fairly beaten;
had the Duke of Cumberland treated them with
the ordinary humanity of civilized war, even as
civilized war was understood in those brutal days,
not one word would have been said against him,
and he might have handed a clean name down to
posterity. As it was, he preferred to give full<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>
play to the most brutal instincts that a man was
ever cursed with.</p>

<p>The chief charge against the Duke of Cumberland,
and the charge is fully substantiated by undeniable
testimony—is that in cold blood he ordered the
enemy’s wounded to be butchered.</p>

<p>Nay that a barn into which twenty poor wounded
Highland men had crept was deliberately set on
fire, adding to the agony of their wounds the
intolerable pain of death by fire.</p>

<p>That he allowed no sort of attention to be given
to the wounded Scots, but, returning to the field
two days after from the pursuit, and finding still
some poor wounded wretches lying where they
had fallen, he fiendishly ordered them to be put
to death, some by the bullet, some by the bayonet,
some by the clubbed musket.</p>

<p>It is said that he ordered General Wolfe, then a
young officer, to kill a wounded man, but that
Wolfe told him, to his credit, that he would sooner
resign his commission.</p>

<p>And this was the man for whom King George and
his Queen, Caroline, wished to put aside their first-born
son, Frederick, Prince of Wales, whose greatest
fault in their eyes perhaps was his gentleness of
nature; his kindness to the poor and needy!</p>

<p>For this great bloated Butcher, Frederick was
exiled from his family, insulted in public and in
private, and his character assailed in such a way
that his name has been handed down in history as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
one to be scoffed at; though this latter injustice is
mainly the work of one man, Lord Hervey, perhaps
after all his bitterest enemy; certainly the meanest
and most contemptible.</p>

<p>But the details of Cumberland’s inhuman cruelty
did not come out for years after, and meanwhile on
his return to London, he was fêted, received the
thanks of Parliament, and was given a pension of
twenty-five thousand pounds per annum for himself
and his heirs, but fortunately he had none. Truly
the wicked flourish in this world like the bay tree!</p>

<p>But truth will out, <i lang="la">magna est veritas et prevalebit</i>;
little by little came to England the evidence of
eye witnesses, to the savage cruelty of this royal
Prince of five-and-twenty to the poor, half-starved,
maimed Scots; bit by bit the reputation of the
“Butcher” was built up, and it will stand while the
memory of Culloden lasts.</p>

<p>As for Prince Charlie, he was forced from the
field, whilst trying to charge with the remnant of
his men, by an Irish officer in the French service,
named O’Sullivan; he fled to Gortuleg, where that
ancient sinner, Lord Lovat, was residing at the
time, and who gave him but a cold welcome so that
they parted in anger, the Prince not even receiving
a meal.</p>

<p>On to Glengarry’s Castle of Invergarry, rode
Charles through the night with the last few of his
followers, arriving before dawn, only after a brief
rest, to go on and on, with the shadow of the axe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span>
ever hanging over him, till, five months after, he
was taken off by a French ship at Lochnenuagh, the
very same spot where he had landed over a year
before.</p>

<p>But it would not be possible to conclude even this
imperfect sketch of the Prince’s campaign without
paying a tribute to Flora Macdonald, “a name,” says
Dr. Johnson, “which will ever live in history.”
The “little woman of genteel appearance, and uncommonly
well bred.”<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>When Charles was being run down on Long
Island with a price of thirty thousand pounds upon
his head, did not this noble young lady, at the risk
of her life, obtain a pass from her stepfather, a
captain in King George’s militia, for herself, a manservant
and a maid, and did she not smuggle away
the Prince under the very eyes of his pursuers in
the character of the latter, dressed in petticoats?
An achievement on Charles’s part which called forth
from old Macdonald of Kingsburgh the following dry
remark when he saw him crossing a brook and in
difficulties with his petticoats:</p>

<p>“Your enemies call you a Pretender, but if you
be, you are the worst of your trade I ever saw!”</p>

<p>It is a pleasure to know that when Flora Macdonald
paid the penalty of her heroic act, and was
brought a prisoner to London, our Prince Frederick
obtained her release.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span></p>

<p>What a different disposition to his brother, the
Butcher’s!</p>

<p>“And would not you, Madam,” asked Frederick
of his wife, who had spoken against Flora in the
fashion of the time, “would not you in like circumstances
have done the same? I hope—I am sure
you would.”</p>

<p>It is pleasant to think that Flora Macdonald went
home from London with a present of fifteen hundred
pounds from the Jacobite ladies of that place in her
pocket.</p>

<p>All fear of the Pretender being dispelled, the
Court turned to gaiety again, and the principal
social event of the year 1746 was the marriage of
the Princess Mary, the King’s second daughter, to
the Prince of Hesse.</p>

<p>To celebrate this event there were a series of
Royal entertainments, concerning one of which
Horace Walpole relates a humorous incident. “A
most ridiculous tumble t’other night at the Opera.
They had not pegged up his,”—the Prince of
Hesse’s, “box tight after the Ridotto, and down he
came on all fours. George Selwyn says he carried
it off with unembarrassed countenance.”</p>

<p>The marriage, however, proved a sad one for poor
Princess Mary. She was back again in England in
a year, under the excuse of having to drink the
Bath waters, but really to escape from the cruelty
of her husband. She was glad enough to get back
to her favourite brother and sister, the Duke of
Cumberland and the Princess Caroline; the former
just in the full enjoyment of his new title, “the
Butcher.” So common had this sobriquet become
among the public, that when the Duke lost his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>
sword one night at the opera, the people remarked:
“The Butcher has lost his knife!”</p>

<p>However, the troubles of his newly-married
daughter did not much affect the King. He was
particularly annoyed about this time—1747—by a
new opposition created by the Prince of Wales,
which it was declared was to last until he ascended
the throne. Father and son, despite their fussy
reconciliation, were as far apart as ever, and the
reception given by the King to the Duke of
Cumberland after his bloody errand in the North,
had not tended to mend matters.</p>

<p>Horace Walpole thus comments on the Prince’s
new opposition:—</p>

<p>“He began it pretty handsomely the other day,”
he remarks, “with one hundred and forty-three to
one hundred and eighty-four, which has frightened
the Ministry like a bomb. This new Party wants
nothing but heads,” he continues, “though not
having any, to be sure, the struggle is fairer.”</p>

<p>The Party was led by Lord Baltimore, “a man
with a good deal of fumbled knowledge.”</p>

<p>An anecdote is related of the Prince of Wales’s
second son, Edward Duke of York, whom Horace
Walpole describes as “a very plain boy with
strange loose eyes, but was much the favourite. He
is a sayer of things.”</p>

<p>This is one of the “things” recorded of him:—</p>

<p>Baron Steinberg, one of the King’s Hanoverians,
was sent by His Majesty to inform him of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
progress of the Princes George and Edward in their
studies.</p>

<p>Prince Edward showed considerable knowledge of
his Latin Grammar, but Steinberg told him that it
would please the King if he made himself more proficient
in German.</p>

<p>“German, German,” repeated Edward, “any dull
child can learn that.” Saying which he squinted
with his “loose” eyes at the German Baron, who no
doubt went back to the grandfather with a very
unfavourable report.</p>

<p>But the old man was fond of his grandchildren—as
far as it was in his nature to be—and determined
to distinguish his heir at an early age, by conferring
upon him the Order of the Garter; this was done
in 1749, privately in the Palace.</p>

<p>The fact of the Prince of Wales having united his
Party with that of the Jacobites in opposition to the
Government did not interfere with King George
bestowing this honour on his son. Perhaps the old
man was softening a little, and becoming kinder at
any rate to his grandchildren.</p>

<p>The relations existing between the King and the
Prince of Wales at this time are very clearly shown
by the manner in which the Order of the Garter
was conferred on Prince George. The Prince of
Wales carried the child, he was then eleven, in his
arms to the door of the King’s Chamber; there he
was taken in the arms of the Duke of Dorset and
carried within the chamber to the King, the Prince<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>
of Wales remaining where he was, outside the door,
which was half open.</p>

</span><br>PRINCE GEORGE (afterwards George III) AND PRINCE EDWARD, HIS BROTHER,
SONS OF PRINCE FREDERICK, WITH THEIR TUTOR, DR. AYSCOUGH.</p>

<p>The child Prince, arriving in the presence of the
King, commenced to repeat a speech which had been
taught him by his tutor. Dr. Ayscough, Dean of
Bristol. No sooner did the Prince of Wales hear
his son commence his oration than he called out
loudly, “No! No!”</p>

<p>The boy stumbled and stopped and then after an
effort went on again, but his father for some reason
would have none of it, and this time a more
determined “No” stopped little Prince George
altogether, and his fine speech was wasted.</p>

<p>But nevertheless he was duly invested with the
Garter, an honour the magnitude of which it is
doubtful whether he appreciated at that age.</p>

<p>Here is an extract from the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>
recording an event about the same time.</p>

<p>Thursday, 25th May, 1749 (O.S.).</p>

<p>“Being the birthday of H.R.H. Prince George,
who entered into his twelfth year, the nobility and
gentry paid their compliments at Leicester House.
About seven in the evening the silver cup, value
twenty-five guineas, given by the Prince, was rowed
for by seven pairs of oars, from Whitehall to
Putney. Their Royal Highnesses the Prince and
Princess of Wales, with the nobility, were rowed in
their barges ahead of the wager-men, followed by
Prince George, the young Princesses, etc., in a
magnificent new barge, after the Venetian manner,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>
and the watermen dressed in Chinese habits, which,
with the number of galleys attending, rowed by
young gentlemen in neat uniforms, made a splendid
appearance.</p>

<p>“The Prince has also given a plate to be sailed for
by six or seven yachts, or pleasure boats, to the
Nore, and back again.”</p>

<p>This last prize was sailed for on Tuesday, 1st
August, 1749, and was won by the “Princess
Augusta” belonging to George Bellas, Esq., a
“register” of Doctor’s Commons.</p>

<p>The Prince of Wales attended in his Venetian-Chinese
barge (the rowers in Chinese habits) being
greatly cheered by the people, “at which he pulled
off his hat.”</p>

<p>Turning to other matters, there was an accident
at Kensington Palace which occurred when Lady
Yarmouth—our old acquaintance Madame Walmoden—took
up her quarters there, very nearly
causing the demolition of the building, which would
have been an event much to be regretted from the
point of view of picturesqueness.</p>

<p>The Walmoden was installed in the same rooms
which the King’s former mistress the Countess of
Suffolk occupied, and they were exceedingly damp,
a drawback which apparently was not heeded by
Lady Suffolk. The Walmoden, however, was a
chilly person, and contracted ague, which was rather
to be wondered at on such a well-known gravel soil.</p>

<p>However, to counteract this complaint, she made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span>
up such huge fires that the woodwork of the
building caught and the palace was nearly burnt
down.</p>

<p>There were plenty of other less damp rooms, but
the King would not allow them to be used, and commenting
on this Horace Walpole remarks:</p>

<p>“The King hoards all he can, and has locked up
half the Palace since the Queen’s death, so he does
at St. James’s, and I believe would put the rooms
out at interest if he could get a closet a year for
them.”</p>

<p>But as the King grew older, there were no further
signs of a <i lang="fr">rapprochement</i> between himself and his
eldest son, and no doubt the latter’s lavish expenditure—on
such things as Venetian barges with
Chinese crews—tended to set the father as he grew
more avaricious, more against the son. But the
riches hoarded by King George did not endure, but
were swallowed up in that disastrous Hanoverian
campaign, which also swallowed up the military
reputation of the Duke of Cumberland, and put a
final period to his war experiences.</p>

<p>The following extracts from the <i>Gentleman’s
Magazine</i>, for the year 1750, are pathetic when
read by the light of an event which followed but too
quickly.</p>

<p>They represent the Prince, in fine summer
weather, with his wife and children, happily
making a “Progress” and visiting certain English
country towns. There is a holiday air of peace and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span>
relaxation about them all, and the Prince is shown
in those circumstances in which he loved best to live,
with a devoted and beautiful wife, for whom without
doubt he had a tender affection, by his side, and a
bevy of loving children surrounding them both.</p>

<p>So in the balmy summer air, rent by the plaudits
of the people who loved him also, it is better to leave
him so depicted in the last public scene in which he
appears in these pages, for that happy summer of
1750 was the last he spent on earth.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, July 11th, 1750.</i></p>

<p>Their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess
of Wales, and Lady Augusta, eldest daughter of
their Royal Highnesses, arrived at Bath, attended
by the Lords Bathurst, Middlesex, Bute and
Inchiquin, and four or five gentlemen and ladies.
The Mayor, Aldermen and Common Council of Bath
waited on their Royal Highnesses, to congratulate
them on their arrival; when Mr. Clutterbuck,
Deputy Town Clerk, made the following speech:</p>

<p>“May it please your Royal Highnesses to permit
us the Mayor, aldermen and citizens of this city to
approach your Royal Highnesses with hearts full of
joy on your safe arrival here, an addition of your
many favours to us, of which we retain the most
grateful sense. It gives us the greater satisfaction
when we consider that this indulgent visit is not on
the occasion of your Royal Highnesses’ health, and
that it affords us this happy opportunity of congratulating
you on the birth of another Prince, an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>
increase of his Majesty’s family. We beg leave to
assure your Royal Highnesses that the power we
enjoy as magistrates shall, on this and all other
occasions, be exercised in strict loyalty and obedience
to his Majesty and his family.”</p>

<p>To which his Royal Highness returned the
following answer:</p>

<p>“I and the Princess thank you for this mark of
duty to the King and regard to us; the city of Bath
may always depend on my good wishes.”</p>

<p><i>Friday, July 13th.</i></p>

<p>Their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess
of Wales, with the Princess Augusta and some of
the nobility, went on wherries about four miles down
the river from Bath to Salford, and dined in publick
under two tents in a large mead, where abundance
of the country people resorted, and to whom his
Highness gave several hogsheads of beer. A band
of musicians attended the whole time.</p>

<p><i>Letter from Gosport, August 17th, 1750.</i></p>

<p>On the 15th, in the afternoon, their Royal
Highnesses the Prince and Princess of Wales, with
the Princes William and Henry and Princess
Augusta, arrived in the harbour in the Commissioner’s
yacht. Before they went on shore they
did Sir Edward Hawke the honour of a visit on
board the “Monarch” man-of-war; from thence
they went on shore to the Commissioner’s house,
where they lodged that night.</p>

<p>Next morning his Royal Highness surveyed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span>
dock and yard, then went on board the guard-ships,
which were all made clear to receive him; there the
exercise of the great guns was performed in his
presence, at which he expressed much satisfaction.</p>

<p>His Highness afterwards landed at the Sally
Port of Portsmouth, and walked round the fortifications,
attended by one of the engineers with a plan
of them. From whence he went in the Commissioner’s
coach, attended by Sir Edward Hawke,
the Commissioner and engineer, to see Cumberland
Fort, and about three o’clock he embarked on board
the yacht at Southsea Castle. Words cannot
express the joy and pleasure all ranks and degrees
of people expressed at his presence amongst us.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, 18th August, 1750.</i></p>

<p>The Prince and Princess of Wales arrived in the
Isle of Wight, and after viewing Carisbrooke Castle,
came to Newport, and were met by the Mayor and
Corporation in their formalities, and conducted with
great acclamations to the Guildhall, where his Royal
Highness did the Corporation the honour to accept
the freedom of the town, and at five in the evening
departed for Southampton.</p>

<p><i>Southampton, August 18th.</i></p>

<p>About nine in the evening their Royal Highnesses
the Prince and Princess landed at our Key. Our
Mayor being confined to his bed by sickness, they
were met by his deputy, Robert Sadlier, Esquire, and
the rest of the Corporation, in their scarlet robes,
and by Mrs. Mayoress, and several ladies of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span>
town, and conducted to the Council Chamber, where
a collation of sweetmeats and wines of divers kinds
were prepared, preceded by the town trumpets, and
the sergeants bearing the maces and silver oar,
attended with flambeaux and torches, in the midst
of loud acclamations of the populace, the bells in
every church ringing, and the houses being illuminated
all the time of their continuing in the town.</p>

<p>On their Royal Highnesses’ arrival in the Council
Chamber the Prince saluted the ladies present, and
the Corporation and gentlemen had the honour of
kissing their hands (<i>sic</i>); and afterwards, their Royal
Highnesses having taken their seats, Mr. Godfrey,
the Town Clerk, in the name of the Corporation,
made a speech to them, concluding with a humble
request that his Royal Highness would accept the
freedom of the town; with which he complied,
assuring them that he should be always ready to
promote the happiness of the town. His Royal
Highness also upon his being solicited that the
Princes present should be made free, not only
consented thereto, but also directed his two eldest
sons, the Princes George and Edward, to be
enrolled with them. Their Royal Highnesses then
set out for the seat of William Midford, Esquire;
where the two Princes reside for the benefit of the
salt water.</p>

<p>The Duke of Queensberry was also presented
with his freedom and took the usual oath.</p>

<p>Under the date of March 6th, 1751, Bubb Doddington—who
had entered the Prince’s household
in July, 1749—writes in his Diary:</p>

<p>“Went to Leicester House where the Prince told
me he had catched cold the day before at Kew, and
had been blooded.”<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>The full history of the catching of the cold was as
follows:—</p>

<p>It seems that at the commencement of this year
the Prince had had an attack of pleurisy from which
he had not entirely recovered. Nevertheless he was
most careless of his health, a habit he had derived
from his father, who on one occasion, when he
refused to nurse himself was asked by Walpole:</p>

<p>“Sir, do you know what your father died of?
Thinking he could not die!”</p>

<p>Frederick in this way certainly partook of this
attribute of George the Second.</p>

<p>In addition to the attack of pleurisy, the Prince
had during the previous year had a severe fall from
his horse, which had left him ailing. It cannot be
doubted that his constitution had been showing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span>
signs of breaking down for some months before the
attack of pleurisy in the winter.</p>

<p>However, on the 5th of March, 1751, he attended
at the House of Lords to hear his father give his
sanction to some Acts of Parliament.</p>

<p>This ceremony concluded, the Prince left the hot
Chamber, no doubt overcrowded and stuffy, and
came out into the cold March wind, proceeding to
Carlton House in his chair with the windows down.
In other words sitting in a thorough draught. This
was not sufficient; at Carlton House he took off his
heavy ceremonial suit, and replaced it by light
unaired clothing. He appears then to have hurried
off to Kew, and there walked about the Gardens in
a cold wind for three hours. Returning to Carlton
House he lay upon a couch in a room without a
fire, with the windows open.</p>

<p>It appears that the Earl of Egmont, who was a
member of his household, came into the room, and
finding him there reasoned with him on the risk he
was running, no doubt knowing full well that the
Prince was in a weak state of health.</p>

<p>Frederick simply laughed at the idea of danger,
and finally went over to Leicester House.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that when Mr. Doddington
called there the next day, he found him very ill.</p>

<p>But not so ill as to warrant him calling there
again the day following.</p>

<p>He went, however, on March 8th, and this is the
entry he made of the visit in his diary:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span></p>

<p>“March 8th. The Prince not recovered. Our
passing the next week at Kew put off.”</p>

<p>Doddington did not consider the Prince ill enough
for a visit on the 9th, but he went there again on
the 10th.</p>

<p>“At Leicester House. The Prince was better
and saw company.”</p>

<p>Incredible as it may appear, the Prince seems to
have gone out to supper at Carlton House on the
12th, and relapsed of course.</p>

<p>Doddington did not go again until the 13th, and
then he recorded the following:—</p>

<p>“At Leicester House. The Prince did not
appear, having a return of a pain in his side.” And
no wonder!</p>

<p>This pain in his side was the worst symptom
of the Prince’s illness, had the doctors but known
it; but the diagnosis of a case in those days must
have been a very rough and ready affair.</p>

<p>It has been mentioned that some years before
Frederick had received a blow on the chest from a
cricket ball—some say a tennis ball—while playing
on the lawn at Cliefden. It had caused him some
pain, but, as usual, he had neglected it, and some
trouble had formed there; trouble perhaps, fostered by
the abundance of the <i lang="fr">bons-pères</i> the Prince was in the
habit of drinking in the custom of the time. Now
on the 13th of March Doddington records that the
Prince had a return of a pain in his side. This was
doubtless the old spot injured by the cricket ball.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span></p>

<p>Doddington was evidently now getting alarmed—and
he had reason for it, for all his hopes and many
ambitions were centred in the Prince—he went to
Leicester House the next day and writes down
carefully the result of his visit.</p>

<p>“14. At Leicester House. The Prince asleep—twice
blooded, and with a blister on his back, as
also on both legs, that night.”</p>

<p>He was there again on the 15th.</p>

<p>“The Prince ... and was out of all
danger.”</p>

<p>“16. The Prince without pain or fever.”</p>

<p>It is told that in this painless interval, Frederick
did that, which perhaps he had been longing to do
in those weary days and nights of suffering. He
sent for his eldest son George. Then when the boy
came, in his state of weakness, his mind seemed to
revert to the unkindness of his own father and the
bitterness that unkindness had mingled with his
life. With his arms round the child he dearly
loved, and with the boy’s fair head drawn down to
his own, he said these touching words:—</p>

<p>“Come, George, let us be good friends while we
are permitted to be so.”</p>

<p>He had evidently, in his mind, the fear that his
father would sooner or later come between him and
his boy.</p>

<p>The Prince is said to have had three physicians
in attendance on him, of whom Dr. Lee was one,
and two surgeons, Wilmot and Hawkins, to do the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span>
copious blood letting, which doubtless drained away
his strength.</p>

<p>But of these five doctors not one saw the
imminent danger he was in.</p>

<p>Doddington, however, was still anxious, and was at
the Prince’s again on the 17th.</p>

<p>“Went twice to Leicester House. The Prince
had a bad night, till one this morning, then was
better, and continued so.”</p>

<p>He was there again on the 18th.</p>

<p>“The Prince better and sat up half an hour.”</p>

<p>The general impression then was that Frederick
was recovering, and Doddington did not call again
the next day at all. Cards were indulged in by
the members of the Prince’s family and some of the
household in an adjacent room, and Frederick’s
faithful follower Desnoyers, the French dancing-master
and violinist, was admitted to soothe the
invalid with his beautiful music. He sat by the bed
and played to him with that wonderful touch for
which he was celebrated.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to reconstruct that scene on the
evening of the 20th of March. Doddington had
called at Leicester House at three o’clock in the
afternoon, and had been told that the Prince was
much better and had slept eight hours the night
before. Doddington had gone off quite satisfied to
the House of Commons.</p>

<p>But now it is evening, late evening, past nine
o’clock, the Prince is lying thoughtful in his high<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span>
four-post bedstead. The room is lighted by wax
candles, their glare shaded from his eyes by the
curtains of the bed; by his bedside is the old
French dancing-master, violin in hand playing some
soft melody which Frederick loves; this soft strain
is broken occasionally by the voices of the card
players in an adjoining room.</p>

<p>Stealing about the large room with soft tread are
the pompous doctors, the <em>ignorant</em> doctors, who
declared their patient to be getting well.</p>

<p>Stately bewigged powdered men these, with
silver topped canes carried almost as wands of office;
ready at a moment’s notice to draw the lifeblood
from their patient, or to order their dispensers in
attendance on them in a room hard by to pound up a
nauseous drug, in a great mortar, to be administered
crude in a revolting draught without any attempt
to conceal its horrid taste, for medicine was not
administered in those days, in attractive tinctures,
with every bitterness covered by some subtle
flavouring; it was taken usually in the form of a
gritty, stringy draught which turned the stomach
of the patient.</p>

<p>But around the sick chamber flitted the young
wife of Frederick; she was only thirty-two then,
and the mother of eight children, which number was
very soon to be increased to nine. She was a most
devoted wife and scarcely left him, it is said, during
his illness.</p>

<p>There Frederick lay thinking, with the soft notes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span>
of the violin floating around him, and the jarring
laughter of the card players breaking in upon him
at times. Perhaps he was thinking of his boy
George as the music moved him, as it will an
artistic nature.</p>

<p>“Come, George, let us be good friends while we
are permitted to be so!”</p>

<p>A clock has just struck the half hour after nine;
perhaps the last thought in Frederick’s mind, as he
is lying there listening to Desnoyer’s music, is of the
God he is so soon to meet. The hand of the clock
creeps on to the quarter; it is nearly a quarter to
ten.</p>

<p>Suddenly the music stops. Frederick is taken
with a violent fit of coughing; when it ceases, Dr.
Wilmot comes to the bedside.</p>

<p>“I trust Your Royal Highness will be better
now, and pass a quiet night.”</p>

<p>The Princess comes to the foot of the bed and
leans over it; Dr. Hawkins approaches the Prince
with a candle and gazes anxiously at him; at last
he sees something which alarms him, the cough
breaks out again with increased violence, Desnoyer
places his arms round the Prince and raises him in
the bed to relieve him, as he does so the Prince
shivers and cries out:—</p>

<p>“Je sens la mort!” (I feel death.)</p>

<p>Desnoyers alarmed, cries out to the Princess at
the foot of the bed:—</p>

<p>“Madame, the Prince is going.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span>
She rushes round to the head of the bed and
bends over her husband.</p>

<p>It is over; he is dead.</p>

<p>And from the next room comes a burst of
laughter from the card players.</p>

<p>Under this date of March 20th, Doddington
continues his entry in his diary:—</p>

<p>“I suppose the mortification was forming, for he
died this evening a quarter before ten o’clock, as I
found by a letter from Mr. Breton at six o’clock
the following morning.”</p>

<p>Doddington continues on the 21st:—</p>

<p>“I came immediately to town,” he lived at
Hammersmith, “and learned from Mr. Breton, who
was at Leicester House when the Prince died, that
for half an hour before he was very cheerful, asked
to see some of his friends, ate some bread and butter,
and drank coffee; he had spit for some days, and
was at once seized with a fit of coughing and
spitting, which last was so violent that it suffocated
him. Lord North was sent to the King. This
morning the King ordered the body to be opened—an
abscess was found in his side, the breaking of
which destroyed him.</p>

<p>“His physicians, Wilmot and Lee, knew nothing
of his distemper, as they declared half an hour
before he died ‘that his pulse was like a man’s in
perfect health.’ They either would not see or did
not know the consequences of the black thrush<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span>
which appeared in his mouth and quite down into
his throat. Their ignorance, or their knowledge of
his disorder, renders them equally inexcusable for
not calling in other assistance.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Augusta, his wife, remained by his corpse for
four hours, steadfastly refusing to believe that he
was dead. Her position was pitiable, as she was
about to become the mother of her ninth child, and
felt all the desolation of a woman in her condition
at being left to battle with her trouble alone.</p>

<p>“It was six in the morning before her ladies
could persuade her to go to bed, and even then she
remained there but two hours. Some long ago
exacted promise given to her dead husband seems
to have disturbed her mind; she rose and went
back into Frederick’s chamber, and there burnt the
whole of the Prince’s papers.</p>

<p>“So it was given out, but it is possible that she
retained some, and that they had a bearing upon
certain events which occurred later, and which will
be spoken of in their place.”</p>

<p>Doran comments on this fact as follows:—</p>

<p>“By this action the world lost some rare supplementary
chapters to a <i>Chronique Scandaleuse</i>.”</p>

<p>That might have been so, or not.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“When Lord North arrived at Kensington
Palace with the news of the death of the Prince, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</span>
found the King looking over a card table at which
sat his daughter, the Princess Amelia, the Duchess
of Dorset, the Duke of Grafton, and the Countess of
Yarmouth—the Walmoden; the Georges seemed
fond of giving Norfolk titles to their improper
belongings—<i>vide</i> Walsingham. Lord North entered
quietly and stood beside the King; in a whisper he
told him of his son’s death.</p>

<p>“‘Dead, is he?’ he remarked turning to the
messenger, ‘why, they told me he was better.’
Then he went round and leant over his mistress’s
shoulder:</p>

<p>“‘Countess,’ he said very casually, ‘Fred is gone.’</p>

<p>That was all!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Father of Mercy! Thy hand that wounds alone
can save!” wails poor Doddington in his diary, on
the 21st; and he appears to have been genuinely
grief-stricken at the death of his patron.</p>

<p>“I went to Leicester House,” he continues on the
22nd. “The Princess afflicted, but well. Went to
Council at night, which was very full. The
common prayer altered, but Prince George left as
he now stands. The physicians made a report and
delivered a paper, being an account of the body
when opened—I have a copy of it—ordered the
bowels to be put into a box covered with red velvet,
and carried in one of the Prince’s coaches by such
attendants as his Groom of the Stole should appoint,
and buried in Henry the Seventh’s Chapel. Ordered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span>
a Committee to settle the ceremonies of the
funeral.”</p>

<p>On the 27th he made another entry concerning
his dead master:—</p>

<p>“Went to Council. Orders to the Lord Steward
and Chamberlain to issue orders for black cloth,
wax lights, etc., for the rooms at Westminster
where the body is to be laid, etc. To the Groom of
the Stole and master of the horse to his late Royal
Highness to regulate the march of the servants, etc.
Orders to the Earl Marshal to direct the Heralds to
prepare, for the consideration of the Council, a
ceremonial for the funeral of his Royal Highness,
upon the plan of those of the Duke of Gloucester
and of Prince George of Denmark, which were
formed upon the plan of the funeral of Charles the
Second.”</p>

<p>April 3rd:—</p>

<p>“At Council about the funeral, ceremonial from
the Heralds read—their orders were to form it on
the plan of the Duke of Gloucester’s and Prince
George’s of Denmark. But they had different
orders privately, which then I did not know. I
thought there was very little ceremony, and
therefore said that I supposed that they had
complied with the orders which their lordships gave
about the plans on which the funeral was to be
formed. The lords said: ‘To be sure’; and none
seemed to have any doubts, or concerned themselves
about it; so I said no more, though I am satisfied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span>
that it is far short of any funeral of any son of a
King. After the Council was up, I asked the Lord
Chancellor about it, who said that he supposed the
Heralds had complied with their orders, but he
knew nothing of it, and had never seen any of the
plans. I told him that I mentioned it, because if it
should appear that any mark of respect to the
deceased should be wanting in this funeral, it would
certainly give great distaste. I think the plan
must be altered.”</p>

<p>Doddington was not aware of the meanness of
the King and Court party towards the Prince’s
memory, but he had a good opportunity of
realising it a little later on.</p>

<p>April 4th:</p>

<p>“The King was at Leicester House”</p>

<p>George seems to have shown some kindness to
the widowed Princess, and to have done what he
could to comfort her as far as it was in his nature,
but no doubt her greatest comfort was in her
children, especially the eldest boy.</p>

<p>When George heard of the death of his father—to
whom he was devoted—he very naturally
turned white and sick.</p>

<p>“I am afraid, sir, you are not well,” pompously
remarked his tutor, Ayscough, who was present
when the news was broken, instead of comforting
the boy.</p>

<p>“I feel,” answered George, with his hand on his
heart, “I feel something here, just as I did when I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span>
saw the two workmen fall from the scaffold at
Kew.”</p>

<p>And no doubt the poor fellow did feel a pain at
his heartstrings, for he loved his father.</p>

<p>Doddington’s diary is almost a chronicle of the
events which followed:</p>

<p>April 13th. “Lord Limerick consulted with me
about walking at the funeral. By the Earl
Marshal’s order, published in the common newspaper
of the day (which with the ceremonial not
published till ten o’clock I keep by me), neither he
as an Irish peer nor I as a Privy Councillor, could
walk. He expressed a strong resolution to pay
his last duty to his royal friend, if practicable. I
begged him to stay till I could get the ceremonial;
he did, and we there found in a note that we might
walk. Which note, published seven or eight hours
before, the attendance required was all the notice
that lords, their sons, and Privy Councillors had
(except those appointed to particular functions) that
they would be admitted to walk.”</p>

<p>April 13th. “At seven o’clock I went, according to
the order, to the House of Lords. The many slights
that the poor remains of a much-loved master and
friend had met with, and was now preparing the
last trouble he could give his enemies, sunk me
so low, that for the first hour I was incapable of
making any observation.</p>

<p>“The procession began, and (except the lords
appointed to hold the pall and attend the chief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span>
mourner, and those of his own domestics) when
the attendants were called in their ranks, there was
not one English lord, not <em>one</em> bishop, and only one
Irish lord (Limerick), two sons of dukes (Earl of
Drumlanrig and Lord Robert Bertie), one Baron’s
son (Mr. Edgecumbe), and two Privy Councillors
(Sir John Rushout and myself), out of these great
bodies to make a show of duty to a prince, so great
in rank and expectation.</p>

<p>“While we were in the House of Lords it rained
very hard, as it has done all the season; when
we came into Palace Yard, the way to the Abbey
was lined with soldiers, but the managers had
not afforded the slightest covering over our
heads; but, by good fortune, while we were
from under cover, it held up. We went into the
south-east door, and turned short into Henry the
Seventh’s Chapel. The service was performed
without either anthem or organ. So ended the sad
day. <i lang="la">Quem semper acerbum—semper honoratum.</i></p>

<p>“The corpse and bowels were removed last night
to the Prince’s lodgings at the House of Lords;
the whole Bedchamber were ordered to attend them
from ten in the morning till the <i lang="fr">enterrement</i>. There
was not the attention to order the Green-Cloth to
provide them a bit of bread; and these gentlemen,
of the first rank and distinction, in discharge of their
last sad duty to a loved and a loving master, were
forced to bespeak a great cold dinner from a common
tavern in the neighbourhood. At three o’clock,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span>
indeed, they vouchsafed to think of a dinner, and
ordered one—but the disgrace was complete; the
tavern dinner was paid for and given to the poor.</p>

<p class="center caption">BUBB DODDINGTON.<br>Lord Melcombe.</p>

<p>“N.B.—The Duke of Somerset was Chief
Mourner, notwithstanding the flourishing state of
the Royal Family.”</p>

<p>So ends Bubb Doddington’s account of the
Prince’s illness, death and burial, and it will be
seen from his description of the latter that King
George the Second’s hatred for his eldest son did
not cease with death, but that his petty animosity
went beyond it to the grave, and touched those who
stood around it.</p>

<p>On such a nature it would be vain to waste good
English words, his own reflections on the events
of this year are the best comment and explanation
of it, and it is a sort of pleasure to think that these
words suggest some ring of sorrow in them for his
actions past.</p>

<p>Touched by the death of his daughter, the Queen
of Denmark, George the Second made the following
soliloquy.</p>

<p>“This (1751) has been a fatal year to my family,”
he said “I have lost my eldest son, <em>but I
was glad of it</em>. Then the Prince of Orange
died and left everything in confusion. Poor
little Edward has been cut open for an imposthume
in his side, and now the Queen of Denmark is gone!
I know I did not love my children when they were
young. I hated to have them coming into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</span>
room. But now I love them as well as most
fathers.”<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>After a long description of the sepulture of the
<i>viscera</i> of the Prince, which appears to have been
attended with almost as much ceremony as his
funeral, and seems to have attracted a ghoulish
interest, the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> for April,
1751, proceeds as follows, with an account of the
latter function.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The procession began half-an-hour after eight at
night, and passed through the old Palace Yard to
the south-west door of Westminster Abbey, and so
directly to the steps leading to Henry the Seventh’s
Chapel.</p>

<p>The Ceremonial was as follows:</p>

<p class="center">
    <br>Knight Marshals, men, with black staves, two and two.
    <br>Gentlemen Servants to his Royal Highness.

    <br>two and two.
    <br>Yeomen of the Guard to close the Procession.<br>
  </p>

<p>The corpse of His Royal Highness was met at
the Church door by the Dean and Prebendaries
attended by the gentlemen of the Choir and King’s
Scholars, who fell into the Procession immediately
before the Officer of Arms, with wax tapers in their
hands and properly habited, and began the Common
Burial Service (no Anthem being composed on this
occasion) two drums beating a Dead March during
the service.</p>

<p>Upon entering the Chapel, the Royal body was
placed on trestles, the crown and cushion at the
head, and the canopy held over, the supporters of
the pall standing by; the chief mourner and his
two supporters seated in chairs at the head of the
corpse; the Lords Assistants, Master of the Horse,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</span>
Groom of the Stole, and Lords of the Bedchamber
on both sides; the four white staff officers at the
feet, the others seating themselves in the stalls on
each side the chapel.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Rochester, Dean of Westminster,
then read the first part of the Burial Service, after
which the corpse was carried to the vault, preceded
by the white staff Officers, the Master of the Horse,
Chief Mourner, his supporters and Assistants,
Garter King of Arms going before them.</p>

<p>When they had placed themselves near the vault,
the corpse being laid upon a machine even with the
pavement of the Chapel, was by degrees let down
into the vault when the Bishop of Rochester went
on with the service; which being ended, Garter
proclaimed his late Royal Highness’s titles in the
following:—</p>

<p>“Thus it hath pleased Almighty God to take out
of this transitory life to His Divine Mercy, the
illustrious Frederick, Prince of Wales,” etc., etc.</p>

<p>The nobility and attendants returned in the
same order as they proceeded, at half-an-hour after
nine; so that the whole ceremony lasted an hour.</p>

<p>There was the utmost decorum observed, and,
what is remarkable, though the populace were
extremely noisy before the procession began, there
was during the whole a silence that, if possible,
added to the solemnity of so awful a sight.</p>

<p>The Guards, who each of them held two lighted
flambeaux during the whole time, behaved so well,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</span>
that we do not hear of any accident happening
among the spectators that are remarkable. As soon
as the procession began to move, two rockets were
fired off in Old Palace Yard, as a signal to the guns
in the Park to fire, which was followed by those of
the Tower, during which time the great bells of
Westminster and St. Paul’s Cathedral tolled, as did
those of most of the churches in London.</p>

<p>The soldiers were kept on guard all Saturday
night, and on Sunday, at the South Door of the
Abbey, and on the scaffolding in Palace Yard. And
yesterday the workmen began to take down the
scaffolding.</p>

<p>The following inscription was engraved on a silver
plate, and affixed to the coffin of His Royal Highness
the Prince of Wales.</p>


<p class="center">Depositum.</p>

ceremony.</p>

<p>And for the rest, what remains? What flotsam
did this apparently wasted existence leave upon the
surface of the tide of life as it sank beneath it?</p>

<p>Indeed, it is little; little that is reliable, little
that can be trusted as unbiased testimony of his
virtues or his vices.</p>

<p>Horace Walpole and Lord Hervey are the leaders
of his vilifiers, both King’s men, both hating him.</p>

<p>What does Walpole say?</p>

<p>“Thus died Frederick, Prince of Wales, having
resembled his pattern the Black Prince in nothing
but in dying before his father.”</p>

<p>“His chief passion was women....”</p>

<p>“He was really childish, affectedly a protector of
arts and sciences, fond of displaying what he knew;
a mimic, the Lord knows what a mimic—of the
celebrated Duke of Orleans, in imitation of whom he
wrote two or three silly French songs. His best
quality was generosity; his worst, insincerity and
indifference to truth, which appeared so early that
Earl Stanhope wrote to Lord Sunderland from
Hanover, what I shall conclude his character with,
‘He has his father’s head and his mother’s heart.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</span></p>

<p>No great compliment either to his father or
mother if this latter assertion be true!</p>

<p>Lord Hervey, in summing up the Prince’s
character, goes much farther than this, so much
farther indeed that his assertions take the colour of
a very bitter display of personal animosity and
spite. These are his words:</p>

<p>“And when I have mentioned his (the Prince’s)
temper, it is the single ray of light I can throw on
his character to gild the otherwise universal
blackness that belongs to it, and it is surprising how
any character made up of so many contradictions
should never have the good fortune to have stumbled
(<i lang="fr">par contre-coup</i> at least) upon any one virtue; but
as every vice has its opposite vice as well as its
opposite virtue, so this heap of iniquity to complete
at once its uniformity in vice in general, as well as
its contradiction in particular vices like variety of
poisons—whether hot or cold, sweet or bitter—was
still poison, and had never an antidote.”</p>

<p>These stilted passages of Lord Hervey seem to
have been put together with a double object; first
to show his hatred for Prince Frederick; secondly
to display his own learning. Though succeeding
admirably in one, he seems to have failed in the
other. No man of learning would ever commit
himself to assertions which he was not in a position
to substantiate, and Lord Hervey was certainly
never in a position to prove any of the assertions he
put forward against the Prince, or he most assuredly
would have done so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</span></p>

<p>He was no more able to prove these vague charges—they
were always vague, even to the cowardly
hints which he gave in his Memoirs that he knew
<em>something</em>; something very detrimental to the
Prince’s character—than he was able to prove his
boastful assertion to Sir Robert Walpole that he
was the father of Anne Vane’s child, the child which
had been acknowledged by the Prince as his
own.</p>

<p>He stated in his Memoirs that he was aware of
certain facts very damaging to the Prince of Wales,
which accounted for the King and Queen’s hatred of
him. If so then he must have been acquainted with
some crime committed in Frederick’s childhood, say
at the age of seven, for that was about the time
when his father and mother began to hate him.</p>

<p>But what are Lord Hervey’s and Horace Walpole’s
charges against the Prince?</p>

<p>Hervey says he was vicious; Hervey of whom
Sarah of Marlborough remarked:—</p>

<p>“He has certainly parts and wit, but is the most
wretched profligate man that ever was born....”</p>

<p>If Frederick possessed vices, where is there any
record of them in history?</p>

<p>Lord Hervey’s are very thinly veiled, <i>vide</i> Pope’s
verses on him.</p>

<p>It is acknowledged that Frederick made a fool of
himself with women when he was a young unmarried
man, and that this foolishness began over in
Hanover, where he was left a mere boy to his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</span>
resources in an atmosphere permeated with the vices
of his father and grandfather.</p>

<p>There was the Vane episode; true, and he
behaved as honourably as a man could under such
circumstances.</p>

<p>Then there was the affair of Lady Archibald
Hamilton, and that is exceedingly doubtful; doubtful
in the extreme whether there was any guilt
between this young man of seven and twenty and
the plain lady of thirty-five, mother of ten children.
The more one reads of his inner life, the more one
doubts it.</p>

<p>He was certainly vain, and fond of having women
about him, clever women especially, but there cannot
be a scintilla of a doubt that he loved his wife
devotedly, and, moreover, that she possessed the
feminine attribute of attracting him through his
senses, and holding him. The surest way of holding
a husband.</p>

<p>If, therefore, he was devotedly in love with his
pretty wife, and she satisfied him in every way, as
he admits in his verses to her, that she did, what
attraction would two plain women—Lady Archibald
Hamilton and Lady Middlesex have for him, one
eight years older than himself and the mother of ten
children; the other “short and dark like a winter’s
day,” and as “yellow as a November morning?”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes,” remarks one of his enemies, “beauty in
the case of mistresses was never a necessity in the
Prince’s family!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</span></p>

<p>This assertion is quite wrong; George the
Second’s mistresses, Mrs. Howard, Lady Deloraine,
the Walmoden, were all exceedingly pretty, the
little man, though coarse and vulgar, had a great
eye for beauty, and if he could have got her—but he
could not, she was a pure woman—he would have
had one of the most beautiful girls in England,
Mary Bellenden.</p>

<p>In the Prince’s case, Miss Vane, the only
mistress he was known to have had, was described
as a very pretty girl, therefore he was not unacquainted
with beauty.</p>

<p>That Lady Archibald, and Lady Middlesex were
bright, clever, witty women, useful to have in the
Household can be understood; but to say that
the Prince had turned his house into a seraglio as
his grandfather George the First had done, is
absurd.</p>

<p>He was not the same kind of person; his tastes,
his disposition, his feelings were utterly different.</p>

<p>He lived in loose immoral times, and in all
probability was not immaculate, but to say that
he kept two plain mistresses in the same house
as the pretty wife to whom he was absolutely
devoted, and among the children he adored, is
a vile calumny which emanated from persons who
hated him for other reasons, and either could not,
or <em>would</em> not, understand his nature.</p>

<p>Walpole accuses him of lying, but as usual gives no
proof. Where are the lies? We know his father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</span>
lied; it can be traced in history, but where are
Frederick’s lies?</p>

<p>In the numerous letters he wrote and which have
appeared in these pages, especially those excusing
the removal of his wife from Hampton Court,
surely there would have been traceable some of
these gross falsehoods of which he is accused.</p>

<p>But there are none. Excuses, fencing apologies—and
we can guess the reason—yes; but lies; no.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to the other side, and hear
what the impartial witnesses of his life say
about him:</p>

<p>Here is an extract from a letter written by the
Duchess of Somerset to Dr. Doddridge:</p>

<p>“Providence seems to have directed the blow
where we thought ourselves the most secure; for
among the many schemes of hopes and fears which
people were laying down to themselves, this was
never mentioned as a supposable event. The
harmony which appears to subsist between His
Majesty and the Princess of Wales, is the best
support for the spirits of the nation under their
present concern and astonishment. He died in
the forty-fifth year of his age, and is generally
allowed to have been a prince of amiable and
generous disposition, of elegant manners and
considerable talent.”</p>

<p>“When the Rambler appeared, he so enjoyed
its stately wisdom,” says Dr. Doran, “that he sought
after the author in order to serve him if he needed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</span>
service. His method of serving an author was not
mere lip compliment. Pope indeed might be satisfied
with receiving from him a complimentary visit
at Twickenham. The poet there was on equal
terms with the Prince; and when the latter asked
him how it was that the author who hurled his
shafts against kings could be so friendly towards
the son of a King, Pope somewhat pertly answered,
that he who dreaded the lion, might safely enough
fondle the cub. But Frederick could really be
princely to authors, and what is even more, he could do
a good action gracefully, an immense point where
there is a good action to be done.</p>

<p>“Thus to Tindal he sent a gold medal worth forty
guineas; and to dry and dusty Glover, for whose
‘Leonidas’ he had much respect, he sent a note
for five hundred pounds, when the poet was in
difficulties. This handsome gift, too, was sent
unasked. The son of song was honoured, and not
humiliated, by the gift.</p>

<p>“It does not matter whether Lyttelton or any
one else taught him to be the patron of literature
and literary men; it is to his credit that he
recognised them, acknowledged their services, and
saw them with pleasure at his little court, often
giving them precedence over those whose greatness
was the mere result of accident of birth.”</p>

<p>And this little anecdote of Lady Huntingdon.</p>

<p>He missed her from his circle one day, and asked
Lady Charlotte Edwin where she was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</span></p>

<p>“Oh! I dare say,” exclaimed Lady Charlotte,
who was not pious then, but became so after, “I
dare say she is praying with her beggars!”</p>

<p>Frederick the “childish,” “whose passion was
women,” turned and looked at her.</p>

<p>“Lady Charlotte,” he answered, “when I am
dying I think I shall be happy to seize the skirt
of Lady Huntingdon’s mantle to lift me up to
Heaven!”</p>

<p>Finally, listen to what Dr. Doran says of him a
hundred years after, summing up his character.</p>

<p>“He walked the streets unattended to the great
delight of the people;<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> was the presiding Apollo
at great festivals, conferred the prizes at rowings
and racings, and talked familiarly with Thames
fishermen on the mysteries of their craft. He
would enter the cottages of the poor, listen with
patience to their twice-told tales, and partake
with relish of the humble fare presented to him.
So did the old soldier find in him a ready listener
to the story of his campaigns and the subject of
his petitions; and never did the illustrous maimed
appeal to him in vain. He was a man to be loved
in spite of all his vices. He would have been
adored had his virtues been more, or more real.”</p>

<p>And had he any other quality which perhaps
has been forgotten? Some memory of a kindly,
tender feeling, which, maybe, has covered many of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</span>
his sins? Let us think, who have read these pages.
Yes; there was one quality; one which can come
only from the heart of a good man or woman, and
which he possessed in great fulness; a quality much
despised in those days and in these,</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
